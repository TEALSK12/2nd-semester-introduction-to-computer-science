## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Ask students what the while loop did?
    1. Go over the syntax. 
    2. Ask students how you would write this using user input? 
    3. What if you wanted the loop to stop when the user inputted "quit". Ask the students to think and then have a few come up to the board to write out how. 
2. Lab
    1. Tic-tac-toe with many movies 
3. Opportunities for more
    1. If there is a lot of extra time start reviewing concepts and going over any issues. 
    2. If there is more time have students start reading through the project specs.
