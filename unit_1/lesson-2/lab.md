# Lab 1.03

## Part 1 - Printing Practice

Practice typing out some statements in the editor part of the IDE, then hit "Run" at the top of the screen:

| Expression | Expected Output | Did anything unexpected happen? |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `print("1")` |  |  |  |
| `print(1)` |  |  |  |
| `print(1 + 2)` |  |  |  |
| `print("1" + "2")` |  |  |  |
| `print("this" + " " + "is" + " " + "a" + " " + "sentence" + ".")` |  |  |  |

## Part 2 - Variables Practice

1. Type and run the following code. 

   ```python
   animal = "dogs"
   print(animal + " are really cool.")
   ```

   What happens? How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead? 

2. Type and run the following code. 

   ```python
   print(dogs + " are cool.")
   ```

   What output does this produce? Why does this happen?

3. Rewrite the following SNAP! program in Python:

## Part 3 - Four Fours

The four fours challenge! Using four 4's and any operations, try to write equations that have the numbers from 0 to 4 as the answer. You should use Python's arithmetic operations:

* * addition
* * subtraction or negation
* * multiplication
* /    division
* \(   \)    parentheses for grouping
* \*\*    power

You may also use 44 or 4.4, which count as two fours, or .4, which counts as one four.   
 For example, one solution for zero is:

```python
print("Zero is", 44-44)
```

  
 Can you find a different solution?   
 Here are what the results, but not the source code, will look like. \(Note: answers may have trailing zeros if floating point arithmetic is used which is fine, i.e. 1 may be displayed as 1.0\)   


```text
Zero is 0
One is 1
Two is 2
Three is 3
Four is 4
```

## Bonus!

Print the output below, but only using **one** line of code. Feel free to use online resources.

```text
Wow!
This is on a new line!
```

## Bonus 2!

Can you find four fours for 5 to 10?
