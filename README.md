# About this curriculum
Welcome to the TEALS Intro to Computer Science Part 2 Curriculum.
This curriculum is intended for use by TEALS classrooms teaching Introduction to Computer Science in a yearlong format. We expect that students have completed the content from the [1st semester course](https://www.gitbook.com/book/teals-introcs/introduction-to-computer-science-principles/details) prior to this curriculum.

Please help us complete it by contributing feedback and suggestions via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TEALS-IntroCS/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science-principles) that contains the source files for this gitbook: https://github.com/TEALS-IntroCS/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science-principles

# Python Versions (2 vs 3)
Python is an evolving language. Python 3 is major upgrade to the language, released in 2010. There is a lot of existing software written under Python 2 and there is resistance to upgrading to Python 3 due to code breakage and cost. Just as a car part from a 10 year old model car will probably not fit a new model of the same car, Python 2 code probably would not run in a Python 3 environment. In Python 3 there are new features, significant upgrades "underneath" which makes the code run better and/or faster as well as no longer supporting (deprecating) some Python 2 capabilities. When looking at Python code, be careful to note whether it is Python2 or Pynton3.

**This class will use Python 3.**
