## Part 1
Open up the terminal. Type the following code. 
```
 a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 b = a[0:2]
 print(a)
 print(b)
 
```

What happens to a? What is b? What type is b?

## Part 2 
```
 a = []
 print(len(a))
 a.append('First Item')
 print(a)
 
```
What was the length of `[]`?
<br>

What does `append` do? What would the length be after `append`? 
<br>

Type the following into the terminal. What happens? 
```
 a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 a.remove('First Item')
 print(a) 
```
