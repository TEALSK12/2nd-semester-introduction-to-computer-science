1. Predict what will be printed. Then run the program and confirm. 
    *  
    *  ```
        a = 0
        while a< 100: 
            print(a)```
    <br>
    *  
    *  ```
        a = 0
        while a < 100: 
            a = a + 1
            print(a)```
    <br>
    
    *  
    *  ```
        a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        b = a.remove('b')
        print(a)
        print(b)```

2. Remember the tic-tac-toe board we created in class? We are going to start implementing tic-tac-toe.
    * User picks a location on the board according to the number: 
    ![tic-tac-toe](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRrA_MowUM-KZXl1CpkrQhi8W505dM3cxZG1787i9qFz8KefqFkIQ)
    * depending on the position user gave,  update the position of the board to reflect that
    * print the board out
