# Sample Rubric

**Many of the python units have the option for more than one project. The rubric provided is an objective based rubric that can be used to asses either project. These rubrics could also be used as a guide to create new projects.**

**This is a sample of how you might fill out the rubric to assess students progress with unit 7 skills.**

### The Student can create a class and an instance (7.01, 7.02)
| 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |Points|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**X** Student creates classes correctly| Student usually creates classes correctly| Student attempts to create classes| No evidence that the student can create classes | 3 |
|**X** Student correctly creates instances of a class| Student usually creates and instance of a class correctly| Student attempts to create a class| No evidence that the student can create a instance of a class|3 |
|**X** Student instantiates a class with arguments  |__| Student attempts to instantiate a class with arguments| No evidence the student can instantiate a class with arguments|3

|**Sub Total**|||**5**|

**TEALS encourages you to talk with your teaching team to decide how much weight you want to give these projects. The raw score can be multiplied by a weighted value so the project fits into the grading scheme that works for your team and students.**
