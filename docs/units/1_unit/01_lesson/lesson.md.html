**Introduction to Computer Science - Python Programming**
# Lesson 1.01: Set Up

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **IDE**, **Python**
* Identify the key concepts that will be covered in the course
* Set up and log into an account for the course's IDE
* Save and turn in a file

## Materials/Preparation

* Update the collaboration policy, IDE information, grading percentages, and general syllabus based on your preferences and your school's requirements
* With your teaching team determine which IDE to use with your class.
* [Python Code]: code to display and have students submit online
* Student Notebooks
* Decide which IDE will be used for the classroom for the semester
* Note: As with all software services, it is the school's sole decision to use the tool according to the use terms and privacy policies provided by its licensor and it is the school's responsibility to ensure the tool meets it's IT policies.

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students download and install IDE to be used for class this semester.

### 2. Syllabus

* Guide students through the syllabus, pausing for questions as needed.
* Make sure to note the overarching goals for the course: create functioning Python programs, learn to use basic data types, and learn to use a text-based language.
* Present demo of a program written in Python to hook students and to give them an idea of what they will be working with.

### 3. Python/IDE Intro

#### Introduce Python

* **Python** is a text-based programming language, uses tabbing/indentation to control execution, and is known for its readability.
* Show [Python Code].  Ask students to write down at least 3 specific things they observe about the program/code in their notebooks.
* Possible responses might include: indentation, different colors of text, using "print" instead of "say" (Snap).
* Discuss what students observed.

#### Introduce IDE - Integrated Development Environment

* An **IDE** is an application that allows you to create, edit, save, and run programs.
* Point out that for this course we will be using an online IDE.
* Note that with Python, we can't use drag and drop blocks anymore - it is a language that must be typed into an IDE.
* Talk to students about the different areas and parts of the IDE, use the [Python Code][] to demo once more how it looks/works.

#### Activity (instructor should demonstrate while students are following along on their computers)

* Hello World exercise
* Display [Python Code].  
* Have students create a a new Python file
* Save file as "hello_world.py"
* Have students type in the displayed code into the blank `hello_world.py` file
* If students finish early, encourage them to explore the interface and to try creating a program that prints their name.
