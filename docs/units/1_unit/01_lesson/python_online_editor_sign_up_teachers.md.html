## Student Work Turn-in Procedure
There are two different ways for students to submit their work: 
1. Have students share their project link with teachers/TAs. This only needs to happen once.
    
2. Have students download their file and upload it to the school's Learning Management System (or however students normally hand in electronic files at the particular school)
