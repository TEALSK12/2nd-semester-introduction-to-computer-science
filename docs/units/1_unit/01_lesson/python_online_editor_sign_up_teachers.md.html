# Python Online Editor Sign Up
We will be using the online IDE [Trinket](https://trinket.io) to write Python code this semester.  Below are instructions for how to sign up for an account, as well as how to collect and review student work. 

## Sign Up Instructions for teachers using a free Code account
1. Follow instructions to create teacher Trinket account and sign up for school plan: [Sign Up Guide Teachers Code].

## Sign Up Instructions for teachers using a paid Connect account
1. Follow instructions to log into your teacher Trinket account: [Sign Up Guide Teachers Connect].


## Student Work Turn-in Procedure
There are two different ways for students to submit their work: 
1. Have students share their project link with teachers/TAs. This only needs to happen once.
    
2. Have students download their file and upload it to the school's Learning Management System (or however students normally hand in electronic files at the particular school)
