# Lab 1.03 - Printing & Variables

## Part 1 - Printing Practice

Practice typing out some statements in the editor part of the IDE, then hit "Run" at the top of the screen:

| Expression | Expected Output | Did anything unexpected happen? |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
|`print("1")`|                 |        |
|`print(1)`|                   |        |
|`print(1 + 2)`|               |        |
|`print("1" + "2")`|           |        |
|`print("this" + " " + "is" + " " + "a" + " " + "sentence" + ".")`|

## Part 2 - Variables Practice

### 1. In your Console

#### Type and run the following

```python
animal = "dogs"
print(animal + " are really cool.")
```

### In your Notebook

#### Respond to the following

1. What happens?
2. How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead?

### 2. In your Console

#### Type and run the following code

```python
print(dogs + " are cool.")
```

### Continue In your Notebook

#### Respond to the following questions

1. What output does this produce?
2. Why does this happen?

## Part 3 - Four Fours

### The four fours challenge

Using four 4's and any operations, try to write equations that have the numbers from 0 to 4 as the answer.
You should use Python's arithmetic operations:

* \+    addition
* \-    subtraction or negation
* \*    multiplication
* /    division
* (   )    parentheses for grouping
* **    power

You may also use 44 or 4.4, which count as two fours,
or .4, which counts as one four.
For example, one solution for zero is:

```python
print("Zero is", 44-44)
```

Can you find a different solution?

Here are what the results, but not the source code, will look like. (Note: answers may have trailing zeros if floating point arithmetic is used which is fine, i.e. 1 may be displayed as 1.0)

```python
Zero is 0
One is 1
Two is 2
Three is 3
Four is 4
```

## Bonus

Print the output below, but only using **one** line of code. Feel free to use online resources.

```python
Wow!
This is on a new line!

```

## Bonus 2

Can you find four fours for 5 to 10?
