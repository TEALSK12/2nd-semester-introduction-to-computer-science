# Lab 7.03 - Kangaroo Class

## Instructions

* Finish writing the `__add__` method for the time class from the Do Now.
* Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
  * An `__init__` method that initializes an attribute named `pouch_contents` to an empty list.
  * A method named `put_in_pouch` that takes an object of any type and adds it to `pouch_contents`.
  * A `__str__` method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the contents of the pouch.

### Tips to give students

* This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and difficult to find, errors in Python
* TypeError: Can't convert 'list' object to `str` implicitly
* Use the `str()` function to convert the list object to a string.
* Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects
  * assign them to variables named `kanga` and `roo`
  * add `roo` to the contents of `kanga`’s pouch

## Extra Credit

Return to your Pet class from Lab 7.02. Research the `isinstance` function to write a method, `is_friend` that will take in another pet and return `True` if the two pets are friends, and `false` if they are not.

### Rules

* If they are both dogs they are friends.
* If the instance is a dog and the other pet is a cat, they are friends.
* If the instance is a cat and the other is a dog they are not friends.
* If they are both cats they are not friends.
