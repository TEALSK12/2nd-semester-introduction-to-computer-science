# Lesson 7.02: User-Defined Types, Part 2

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **self**, **`__init__`**
* Create a class with an `init` method
* Understand and use the `self` argument
* Instantiate a class with arguments

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now]
* [Lab - Pet Class] ([printable lab document]) ([editable lab document])
* [Associated Reading - section 7.2](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/readings#7-2)
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief  |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board.
* Students use the `__init__` method and explore how to initialize new objects with one or more arguments.

### 2. Lesson

#### Discuss the Do Now

* Ask Students the following
  * What is the name of the class?
  * where the Pet object get instantiated?

#### Instruction - `__init__`

* `__init__` is a special function that is called when the class is first initialized.
* If there is a print statement added to the `__init__` method, when would it get printed?

#### Instruction - `self`

* `self` is a way of referring to the instance within a function.
* What does `self.name` do and how does that relate to what `my_pet.name` does?
* Previously we had added attributes *after* the class was instantiated, but `self` allows for us to assign those at once in a single method.

### 3. Lab

* Students will make a Pet class. Each pet will have an animal type, color, food, noise, and name.
* Next students write a function that will take a list of pets and print out their name and the food they like to eat.

### 4. Debrief

* Check for student understanding and completion of the lab.
* Review the two key concepts introduced today (`self` and `__init__`)

## Accommodation/Differentiation

As with the previous lesson, be prepared for some students to struggle with the new vocabulary and concepts being introduced. Reinforce the use of vocabulary such as **instantiate**, **object**, and **attribute** so that students are consistently exposed to how to use these terms.
