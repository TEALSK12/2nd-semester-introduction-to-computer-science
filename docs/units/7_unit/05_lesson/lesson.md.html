# Lesson 7.05: Pokemon Project

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Engage in **class design** before beginning coding.
* Apply what was learned with respect to **classes**, **methods**, and **inheritance** to create an implementation of Pokemon.

## Materials/Preparation

* [7.05 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/7_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%207.05%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Project Spec - Pokemon][] ([docx][1]) ([pdf][2])
* [Project Spec - Mailing List][] ([docx][3]) ([pdf][4])
* Solution (access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard][]).

## Instructor's Notes

### Day 1

#### 1. Handout Project Specifications

* Demo a completed project to show user experience.

#### 2. Mini-Lesson

* Discuss **Class Design**.
* If you find yourself creating many classes with similar methods, use inheritance!
* Figure out the actual structure without writing code and use that to create your classes.

#### 3. Project Overview

* Go over the Pokemon project spec.
* Review the major aspects and requirements of the game.

#### 4. Project Planning

* Have students write down the classes and methods they need to create.
* Students should then outline what they will do each day in order to complete the project on time.

### Days 2-7

#### 1. Planning/Questions

* Have students review and update what they want to accomplish that day and any questions they have from the previous day.

#### 2. Review

* If necessary, review any concepts or struggles the class was having.

#### 3. Project Work

* Students work on their projects independently.

#### 4. Wrap Up

* Have the students write down what they struggled on or had a hard time doing.
