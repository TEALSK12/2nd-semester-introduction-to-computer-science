## Instructor's Notes

### Day 1

#### 1. Handout Project Specifications

* Read through the Project Spec with students
* Demo a completed project to show user experience.

#### 2. Mini-Lesson

* Discuss **Class Design**
* If you find yourself creating many classes with similar methods, use inheritance!
* Figure out the actual structure without writing code and use that to create your classes

#### 3. Project Overview

* Go over the Pokemon project spec
* Review the major aspects and requirements of the game

#### 4. Project Planning

* Have students write down the classes and methods they need to create
* Students should then outline what they will do each day in order to complete the project on time

### Days 2-7

#### 1. Planning/Questions

* Have students review and update what they want to accomplish that day and any questions they have from the previous day.

#### 2. Review

* if necessary, review any concepts or struggles the class was having.

#### 3. Project Work

* students work on their projects independently.

#### 4. Wrap Up

* have the students write down what they struggled on or had a hard time doing.
