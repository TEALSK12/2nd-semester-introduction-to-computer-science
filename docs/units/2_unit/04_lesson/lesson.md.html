# Lesson 2.04: Lists

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **list, item, index, integer**.
* Be able to access items from a list using the index.
* Create lists of different types.
* Use the length function.

## Materials/Preparation

* [2.04 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/2_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%202.04%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - Food Chooser][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][]).
* Solution (access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard][]).
* [Associated Readings 2.4](https://tealsk12.github.io/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/readings.md.html#associatedreadings/2.4)
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students follow instructions to create lists and use the `len` function.

### 2. Lesson

#### Instruction

* Ask students to recall what a list is, and how lists were used in Snap!
* A **list** is a sequence of values. In a Python list, values can be any type. The values in a list are called elements or **items**.
* In Python, to create a list you must enclose items in square brackets, and separate multiple items with commas.
* Emphasize that you can have lists of any type (`int, float, string,` etc.) You can even have lists within lists (more on that later...)

#### Discussion

* Ask students what `len` did when they used it in the Do Now.
* Ask students how they tried to print the first item from a list. Was this what they were expecting?

#### More Instruction

* **index**: a map from the position in the list to the element stored there.
* **0-index**: lists are 0 indexed. So the first element in the list is at an index of 0.
* **Out-of-bounds**: what happened when you tried to print an element of a list, using an index value that was too large?

#### More Discussion

* Ask students how they would access the last item in a list of unknown length. (Use the length function!)
* Ask a student to write on the board how they retrieved the last element of a list. Ask another student to write how they would get the second to last element of the list and so on.

#### Demonstration

* After accessing any list element you can change it. Take a moment to demonstrate this syntax before starting the lab.

#### Nested Lists

Have students work through the following examples in their console.

Example 1

```python
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', ['d', 'e']]
    print(len(a_list))
```

Example 2

```python
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', ['d', 'e']]
    b_list = a_list[3]
    print(b_list)
```

In their notebooks, have students explain how they would access the element `d`, starting from the definition of `a_list`.

### 3. Lab

* Practice accessing and updating items in a list.
* Implement program from last lab using lists.
* Create a quiz program.

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab. Wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, you can continue the topic of nested lists. Start off with a simple nested list like `['a', 'b', 'c', [1, 2, 3]]`. Ask the students to guess the length. Ask the students to guess how they would access the item '1' from that list!
