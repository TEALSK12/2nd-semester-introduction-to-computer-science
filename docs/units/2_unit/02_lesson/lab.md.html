# Lab 2.02 - Can I or Can't I?

## In your notebook

Predict if each of the following examples will produce a `True` or `False` output. Check your answers in interactive mode.

### Example 1

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    a > 75 and b == "science"
```

### Example 2

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    a > 75 and b != "science"
```

### Example 3

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    a > 75 or b != "science"
```

### Example 4

```python
    a = 100
    b = "science"
    c = True
    not c and a > 75 and b == "science"
```

## In your console

### Complete the following coding challenge

1. Create a "Can I be President?" program, which determines if the user meets the minimum requirements for becoming the President of the United States. Have the user input the information needed.

    **The minimum requirements to be president of the United States are:**

    * Older than 35
    * Resident of US for 14 Years
    * Natural born citizen
    
    Print True if the person could be president and False if they can't be president.

2. Create a "Can I ride the roller coaster?" program. It will check to see if the user meets the minimum requirements to ride the roller coaster. Have the user input the information needed.

    **Requirements to ride the roller coaster:**
    * Height over 50 inches – loophole allows any height if older than 18
    * Each ride costs 4 quarters.
    * There is a frequent rider pass, which makes the rides only cost 2 quarters.

    Print True if the user can ride the roller coaster, and False if not.

## Bonus

### Are the following expressions equivalent? Research DeMorgan's Laws and write why you think they are the same or why they are not the same

`not(x or y) == not x and not y`

`not(x and y) == not x or not y`
