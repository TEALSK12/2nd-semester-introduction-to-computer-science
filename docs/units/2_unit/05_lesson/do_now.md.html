# Do Now 2.05

## Part 1 - Open up the console

### Type the following example code using interactive mode

### Example 1

```python
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 >>> b = a[0:2]
 >>> print(a)
 >>> print(b)
```

### In your notebook

#### Respond to the following

1. What happens to a?
2. What is b?
3. What type is b?

### Example 2

```python
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 >>> a.remove('First Item')
 >>> print(a)
```

### Continue in your notebook

#### Respond to the following questions

1. What does `remove` do?
2. What would the length of this list be after `remove`?

### Example 3

```python
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 >>> a.pop()
 >>> print(a)
```

### Continue your responses in your notebook

1. what does `pop` do?
2. What is the difference between `remove` and `pop`?

### Example 4

```python
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 >>> b = a + ['Third Item']
 >>> print(a)
 >>> print(b)
```

#### Continue your responses to the following in your notebook

1. What happens to a?
2. What is b?
3. What type is b?

### Example 5

```python

 >>> a = []
 >>> print(len(a))
 >>> a.append('First Item')
 >>> print(a)
```

#### In your Notebook

1. What was the length of `[]`?
