# Rubric - Unit Two Project
<!-- Currently neither project requires students casting, identifying multiple data types, creating lists of different types, or using nested lists. -->
<!-- This project will require a lot of the same skills as previous projects. These skills have not been listed here, as the expectation is that they have already been mastered. -->
