# Do Now 2.03

Write down in your notebook one thing you learned in the previous class.

In the console, create a schedule program. Given the hour of the day print out where you should be. If you're not doing anything else you should be "sleeping".

## Example

    ```python
    >>> What hour? 12pm
    >>> You should be at lunch!
    ```

## In your notebook, answer the following

1. How did you accomplish this?
2. Did you feel like something was missing in your program?  
3. What if you wanted to add in a weekly functionality? For instance, maybe on Tuesday at 4pm you are at soccer practice, but on Thursday at 4pm you are at math club!
4. How would you implement this in your program?
