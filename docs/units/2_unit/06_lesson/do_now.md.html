# Do Now 2.06

## Example 1

### Write down in your notebook:

* How would you print out something 10 times? What about 100? What about 1,000?

### Open up the console, type the following code

```python
    while True:
        print('a')
 ```

### In your notebook, write responses for the following:

1. What happens when you run this code?
2. Try using other Boolean expressions instead of `True`.
3. Using a `while` loop, how would you print out something 10 times? 100? 1000?

## Example 2

### Open up the console. Type and run the following code

```python
    loopCounter = 0
    while loopCounter < 10:
        print('Hello World')
```

### In your notebook, answer the following

1. How many times will it print out?
2. What is the output?

## Example 3

### In the console, add a line (#3 below) to your program:

```python
    loopCounter = 0
    while loopCounter < 10:
        loopCounter = loopCounter + 1
        print('Hello World')
```

### In your notebook, answer the following:

1. How many times will it print out?
