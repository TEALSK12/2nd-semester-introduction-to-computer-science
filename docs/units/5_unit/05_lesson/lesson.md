## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board
* For Days 2-5, the Do Now is time for students to write down issues they had with the project from the day before and what they plan on doing to fix those issues.
* Students should take time to create a timeline for when certain tasks will be completed.

### 2. Project Overview

* Review the terminology, topics, and skills that students have learned from this unit. Talk about any questions or things the students are struggling with.
* Discuss the parts of the song mentioned in the Do Now (chorus, bridge, and verses) and how they fit into building a song.
* Distribute the project spec and talk students through the requirements and scoring rubric.
* Demo a final song for the students to see a finished product.

### 3. Project Planning

* Instruct students to create a project plan for what specifically they will accomplish during each day of the project.
* Take time to check that each student has created a project plan before they begin working on their song.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Certain students that have a limited music background may need additional assistance during the planning phase of the project. Students may need additional examples demonstrating the difference between a verse, chorus, and bridge.
