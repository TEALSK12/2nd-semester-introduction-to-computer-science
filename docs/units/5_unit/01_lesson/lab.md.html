# Lab 5.01 - Intro to EarSketch

Create a basic [EarSketch] project using the following requirements:

* Open the Earsketch DAW and log in.
* Click “Options – Save Script to Cloud” and set a name for your song.
* In comments at the top of your code, include your name, the name of the song (e.g. “Lab 5.01”), and a brief, clear description of the project.
* Set the tempo of the project to 140 BPM.
* Make 4 different variables that will hold the following constants:

  * DUBSTEP_BASS_WOBBLE_007
  * DUBSTEP_PAD_003
  * DUBSTEP_DRUMLOOP_MAIN_005
  * DUBSTEP_LEAD_004

* Make at least 4 tracks using the fitMedia() function. Each track should contain a different audio loop from the other tracks.
* Each of the tracks should start or stop on different measures (e.g. track 1 starts on measure 1, track 2 starts on measure 4, and so on).
* Define and use at least 4 variables using 4 different constants from the EarSketch Audio Loop Browser.
* The project should have a total length of 12 measures.
* Include descriptive comments throughout your script.
* Copy and save the script to your online IDE for turn in.
