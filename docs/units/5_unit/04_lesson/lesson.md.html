# Lesson 5.04: EarSketch User-Defined Functions

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **abstraction**, **section**, **A-B-A form**.
* Create and apply user-defined functions to create songs with complicated form.

## Materials/Preparation

* [5.04 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/3_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%205.04%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - User-Defined Functions][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* [EarSketch Editor][]
* Associated Reading in EarSketch.
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students should be given time to read unit 4 of the EarSketch documentation.
* Students should answer the questions included in the do now and be prepared to discuss them as a class.

### 2. Lesson

* Call on students to discuss the answers to the questions from the Do Now.
* Recap the following key concepts from the reading:
  * **Section**: generally refers to several measures of music (often 2, 4, 8, or 16 measures) that sound like a single musical unit.
  * **A-B-A Form**: a song divided into three sections:
    * Section A: measures 1-4.
    * Section B: measures 5-7. Features contrasting sounds to Section A.
    * Section A (repeated): measures 7-10.
* Ask students about returning the measure number.
* Go over the concept of passing around the measure number and make sure students understand how it would be helpful.
* Since it allows you to change how long/short sections are without updating every function.

### 3. Lab

* Demo a song with **A-B-A Form**:

  [![Somewhere over the Rainbow](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PSZxmZmBfnU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU)

* Students create their own song with the form ABABAB.

### 4. Debrief

* Talk about any of the phrases or issues the students had.
* If time allows, give students the opportunity to demo their songs for the class.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Students that are moving quickly could explore and create alternative song forms (ex. AABA).
