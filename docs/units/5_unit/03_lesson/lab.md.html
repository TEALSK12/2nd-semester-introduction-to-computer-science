# Lab 5.03: Earsketch Control Flow

1. Write a for loop that repeats the given rhythm every other measure from measures 1 to 8 (e.g. 1, 3, 5, etc.) on track 1.
    * Audio loop constant: HIPHOP_STOMP_BEAT_001
    * Rhythm: “0---0-0-00000+++”

2. Create an EarSketch script using the following requirements. Include your name and a description in comments at the top of the file.

    * Create a project with 4 tracks that is at least 16 measures in length.
    * 2 tracks should be music tracks, containing `fitmedia()` function calls.
    * The remaining two tracks should contain `makeBeat()` function calls.
    * One track should use a for loop to repeat a rhythm (beat string) for every measure in the song.
    * The other track should use a for loop to repeat a rhythm for every other measure in the song (e.g. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11…).
