# Lesson 5.03: Earsketch Control Flow

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **modulo**.
* Demonstrate looping and control structures.
* Demonstrate the use of looping concepts in music making via EarSketch.
* Demonstrate using control structures to create music.

## Materials/Preparation

* [5.03 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/5_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%205.03%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - EarSketch Control Flow][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* [EarSketch Editor][]
* Associated Reading in EarSketch.
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* Video Explanation of Modulo in Python (Visual Rhythms).

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students should be given time to read unit 3 of the EarSketch documentation.
* Students should answer the questions included in the do now and be prepared to discuss them as a class.

### 2. Lesson

* Call on students to discuss the answers to the questions from the Do Now.
* Review looping in Python. Look at the examples given in the EarSketch documentation and play them for the class.  
* Review if statements and control flow. As with looping go over examples (starting at section "Conditional Statements in Loops"). Focus on the **modulo** operator, reminding students that it is an operator that returns the remainder after division.

### 3. Lab

* Students practice using looping to make a song a single track. Make sure that students use if statements and the modulo operator.
* Ask the students to practice using looping, effects, and control flow structures while using 2-3 different tracks.

### 4. Debrief

* Talk about any of the common issues that students had with loops and control flow.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Students that are moving quickly can read additional documentation on the EarSketch website in order to move ahead and expand their skills and understanding.
