Beat strings are made up of combinations of three different characters
In your Notebook, Explain the rhythmic meaning of each of the characters

2. This project should have 4 tracks and be 12 measures in length.
3. Each track should use a different/unique audio sample.
4. Create 4 variables that hold audio loop constants.
5. Create 1 variable that holds a beat string.
6. On one track, use the makeBeat() function with your beat string.
  
    * Your beat string rhythm should repeat for all 12 measures of the project.
