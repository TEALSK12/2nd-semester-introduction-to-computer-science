# Lesson 5.02: EarSketch Music

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **rhythm**, **beat**, **tempo**, **measures**, `setEffect()`, `makeBeat()`.
* Demonstrate beats using the functions.
* Demonstrate a loop through items in a list.

## Materials/Preparation

* [5.02 Slide Deck](https://github.com/Areson/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/5_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%205.02%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - EarSketch Music][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* [EarSketch Editor][]
* Associated Reading in EarSketch.
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students should be given time to read unit 2 of the EarSketch documentation.
* Students should answer the questions included in the do now and be prepared to discuss them as a class.

### 2. Lesson

* Call on students to discuss the answers to the questions from the Do Now.

#### Recap t**he following key concepts from the reading

* **Rhythm**: describing how the music moves through time.
* **beat** is the basic unit of time in music.  
  * clapped along to a song, you are clapping on each beat.
  * The length of a beat depends on the overall speed of the song, called the `tempo`.
  * Beats are grouped into **measures**. In EarSketch, measures always have four beats.
* **`makeBeat()`:** instead of composing at the measure-level, we can work at the note-level.
* **parameters:** clip name, track number, measure number, beat string
* **Tempo** is measured in beats per minute (bpm).
  * Clapping at 60 bpm, each beat lasts one second.
  * At 120 bpm, each beat takes half a second.
  * The higher the bpm, the faster the song and the shorter the duration of each beat.
* **`setEffect()`:** add an effect to a track.
  * **Takes parameters:** track number, effect name, effect parameter, effect value.

### 3. Lab

* Follow the EarSketch instructions in the lab to use the `makeBeat()` function.
* Create a simple song with 2 uses of `fitMedia()`, 2 uses of `makeBeat()` and 1 use of an effect.

### 4. Debrief

* Talk about the new functions learned today, and go over any questions about data types and using strings.
* Have students write down two things they have learned so far in Earsketch.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Students can use looping and if statements to their song as an extension activity to make their songs more complex.

Students will likely bring a wide range of background knowledge around music and the related terminology. Offer additional support to those students that are less familiar with the terms being introduced in this lesson.
