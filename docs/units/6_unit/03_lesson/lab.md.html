# Lab 6.03 - Dictionaries Storing Lists

In this lab your job is to create a week-long to-do list using a
Python dictionary. Each key in the dictionary is a day of the
week. Each associated value is a list of items to do that day.

The program repeatedly asks the user
what action they wish to take ( **add** or **get**).

* If the user enters **get**, the program asks for a day of the week, and then returns the to-do list for that day.
* If the user enters **add**, the program asks for a day of the week, then asks for  a new item, then adds it to the specified list.
* If a user tries to add an item that already exists on the list for that day, the program rejects the request.
* At the start of the program the dictionary should be totally empty (containing no keys and no values).

## Example

Here's an example. The program output is shown in bold text, the user
input in regular text.

```python
>>>python3 daily_to_do_list.py
What would you like to do ('add' or 'get')?
add
What day?
Friday
What would you like to add to Fridays to-do list?
practice clarinet
What would you like to do ('add' or 'get')?
get
What day?
Friday
You have to practice clarinet.
What would you like to do('add' or 'get')?
```

## Bonus

It's a bit tedious for the user to have to type in three different lines to add an item to a to-do list. Use `split()` to allow the user
to input `add Friday watch tv and relax`.

Create a variation of the program that doesn't allow any duplicates across any of the days. Make sure when you add a to-do item that it doesn't exist in the to-do lists of any of the days before adding.
