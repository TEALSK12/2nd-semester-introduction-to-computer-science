## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Use dictionaries to create the game [Guess Who][].

## Materials/Preparation

* [6.05 Slide Deck](https://github.com/Areson/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/6_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%206.05%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Project Spec - Buy an Umbrella][] ([docx][1]) ([pdf][2])
* [Project Spec - Guess Who][] ([docx][3]) ([pdf][4])
* [Project Spec - Guess Who (Hockey Canada Edition)][] ([docx][5]) ([pdf][6])
* Solution (access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard][]).
* Read through the do now and project spec so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* Try creating your own variation on the Guess Who game so you are familiar with the potential challenges and bugs your students will hit.
* Review [4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem][]
* [Editable Grading Rubric](https://github.com/Areson/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/6_unit/05_lesson/rubric.docx)

## Pacing Guide

### Day 1

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Review      |
| 10 Minutes | Project Overview        |
| 30 Minutes | Project Planning     |

### Days 2-7

|**Duration**|**Description**|
|--|--|
| 5 Minutes  | Planning/Questions      |
| 10 Minutes | Review (if necessary)      |
| 35 Minutes | Project Work        |
| 5 Minutes | Wrap up     |

## Instructor's Notes - Day 1

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board.
* Students should take a few moments to rank which topics they found most difficult during this unit.

### 2. Review

* Take time to review the concepts students found most challenging during this unit.

### 3. Project Overview

* Go over the project spec details with the students.
* Demo a completed project.

### 4. Planning

* Have the students design the variables, functions, dictionaries, lists, and structure they need, using pseudo code to help them visualize.
* Have the students write out a plan /outline for how they will spend time over next few days.
* Any students that finish their plan and have it checked should begin project work.

## Instructor Notes - Days 2-7

### 1. Planning/Questions

* Have the students write down what they want to accomplish that day and any questions they have from the previous class.

### 2. Review (if necessary)

* Go over any concepts or challenges that students are having.

### 3. Project Work

* Students work independently to complete their projects and meet their daily goals.

### 4. **Wrap Up**

* Discuss common issues that students were having each day, provide suggestions for how to overcome those challenges.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* Some students may need a refresher on using a `while` loop to control whether the game is over or not.
* Some students may also need additional assistance or scaffolding for how to randomly choose a character from the dictionary.
* For students who are looking for more of a challenge, we have added a second project called [Project Spec - Buy an Umbrella][].
