# Project 6: Guess Who (Hockey Canada Edition)

Hockey is part of Canada's DNA.  Every hockey fan must know their favourite team's mascot. 
In Guess Who (Hockey Canada Edition) you’ll be building a text version of a classic board game to guess the mascot character of a Canadian Hockey team.
Dictionaries will be the key to this project. 
 
## Overview
The game should store information on at least 5 different mascots. 
Each character should have a name, primary colour, jersey colour, clue about the mascot, clue about the city, some fun fact.

When the game begins, a character should be randomly selected by the computer. The player can ask for 2 pieces of information about the random character, and then has to make a guess as to who was picked.

### Behavior/Commands
* list: list out all the character's names
* Ask for a piece of information by typing these key words
    * colour:  (primary colour of mascot)
    * jersey:  (primary colour of jersey/outfit)
    * animal: (some clue about the animal)
    * city: (some clue about the city)
    * ff: (some fun fact about the mascot)
* guess <name>: guess a character
* help: displays all commands
* quit: exits the game

### Implementation Details
* To store and access the information you’ll need to use dictionaries, which will allow for quick and direct access.
* Research some information about each of the mascot characters: 
    * Harvey the Hound (Calgary Flames):  https://www.nhl.com/flames/fans/harvey
    * Fin the Whale (Vancouver Canucks): https://www.nhl.com/canucks/fans/fin
    * Youppi! the Giant (Montreal Canadiens): https://www.nhl.com/canadiens/news/youppi-finds-a-new-home/c-488911
    * Hunter (Edmonton Oilers): https://www.nhl.com/oilers/fans/hunter
