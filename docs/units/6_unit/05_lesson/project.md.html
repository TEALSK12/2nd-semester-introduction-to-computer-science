# Project 6: Guess Who

In Guess Who, you’ll be building a text version of the classic board game. Dictionaries will be the key to this project. [Play a Sample Game.](http://www.miniplay.gr/?view=game&gid=76)

## Overview

1. The game should store information on at least 5 different characters.
2. Each character should have a name, gender, age, height, and hair color.
3. When the game begins, a character should be randomly selected by the computer.
4. The player can ask for 2 pieces of information about the random character, and then has to make a guess as to who was picked.

### Behavior/Commands

* list: list out all the character's names
* gender/age/height/hair: asks for a piece of information
* guess name: guess a character
* help: displays all commands
* quit: exits the game

### Implementation Details

To store and access the information you’ll need to use dictionaries, which will allow for quick and direct access.

### Example Output
