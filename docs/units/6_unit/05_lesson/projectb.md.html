# Project 6: Buy an Umbrella

In this project, you will build a text version of a shopping site
where you can browse and filter a catalog of umbrellas before buying
one.

## Overview

The program starts by loading an inventory of umbrella models from a
text file. Afterwards, it greets the user with this message:

```
Welcome to Umbrellas Unlimited, your online market for water
protection. We have over 100 umbrellas for sale. Happy shopping!

Use these commands to navigate our site:

  (n)ext          - view the next page of items
  (p)revious      - view the previous page of items
  (a)dd filter    - narrow your search by adding criteria
  (r)emove filter - broaden your search by deleting criteria
  (m)odify filter - change your search criteria
  (b)uy           - purchase an umbrella from the list shown
  (q)uit          - exit our site
```

Then it allows the user to browse and filter the catalog of available
umbrellas:

```
Showing items 1-5 of 162 items

  1) Samsonite polyester compact umbrella.
     Automatic Open and close, Clear. 2 stars. $8.99
  2) GustBuster plastic compact umbrella.
     Automatic Open only, Yellow. 0.5 stars. $9.04
  3) totes plastic golf umbrella.
     Automatic Open only, Green. 4.5 stars. $9.84
  4) GustBuster polyester standard umbrella.
     Automatic Open only, Red. 1.5 stars. $10.13
  5) Rainlax canvas standard umbrella.
     Yellow. 3.5 stars. $10.16
(b)uy, (n)ext, (p)revious, (a)dd, (r)emove, (m)odify, (h)elp or (q)uit?
```

We are providing you with a text file that
contains the [complete inventory][2] of all 100+ models carried by
Umbrellas Unlimited. Your program should use a dictionary of strings
to represent an umbrella and a list of such dictionaries to represent the
full inventory. To manage the search criteria, your program should us
a dictionary of lists that contain acceptable values for each
attribute of an umbrella.

Although you may build this entire program from scratch, we strongly
suggest you start with the provided scaffolding program. Either way,
we encourage you to follow the implementation plan listed below.

## User Experience

Notice that the list now contains only 6 items, all Samsonite brand and all nylon materials.

### Removing filters

Continuing the previous example, we can remove the brand filter:

```
(b)uy, (n)ext, (p)revious, (a)dd, (r)emove, (m)odify, (h)elp or (q)uit? <b>remove</b>

(b)uy, (n)ext, (p)revious, (a)dd, (r)emove, (m)odify, (h)elp or (q)uit?
```

### Modifying filters

Sometimes you want to allow multiple values for a given attribute, say "Nylon or plastic".
A user can modify their filter to allow this:

```
Current filters:
brand: Samsonite
material: nylon

Showing items 1-5 of 6 items

  1) Samsonite nylon golf umbrella.
     Yellow. 4 stars. $11.80
  2) Samsonite nylon standard umbrella.

  3) Samsonite nylon standard umbrella.
     Red. 2 stars. $24.10
  4) Samsonite nylon golf umbrella.
     Clear. 2.5 stars. $31.40
  5) Samsonite nylon standard umbrella.
     Green. 4.5 stars. $32.95

(b)uy, (n)ext, (p)revious, (a)dd, (r)emove, (m)odify, (h)elp or (q)uit? <b>modify</b>

Filters:
    1) brand: Samsonite
    2) material: nylon
Which filter would you like to modify? -->  <b>2</b>

What item would you like to purchase?-->  <b>8</b>
You have purchased a: Samsonite plastic golf umbrella.
     Yellow. 4.5 stars. $32.85.
 Enjoy!
```

## Data Structures

The key idea of this project is that you can use Python dictionaries
and Python lists together in interesting combinations. We will be
using simple dictionaries of strings, but also dictionaries of lists
and lists of dictionaries!

### Representing an Umbrella

We'll use a simple dictionary of strings to represent each umbrella.
Here's an example umbrella, represented as a dictionary:

```python
one_umbrella = { 'brand': 'Samsonite',
    'size': 'compact',
    'material': 'polyester',
    'auto': 'Open and close',
    'color': 'Clear',
    'stars': '2',
    'price': '8.99',
    }
```

The umbrella has various attributes like brand, size, material, etc.
and each has the value shown.

### Representing the Umbrella Inventory

One umbrella isn't very interesting. Our online marketplace sells over
100 models of umbrellas. Your program should keep track of them as a
list of dictionaries:

```python
umbrellas = [umbrella0, umbrella1, umbrella2, ...]
```

Each umbrella is a dictionary. Of course, you won't want to create
this list of dictionaries by hand -- there's over 100 of them. Rather,
you will use the computer to construct these dictionaries for you. We
have provided you with a simple text file named `inventory.txt` that
lists all the models that Umbrellas Unlimited sells. Here's the
first few lines of that file.

```python
brand,size,material,auto,color,stars,price
Samsonite,compact,polyester,Open and close,Clear,2,8.99
GustBuster,compact,plastic,Open only,Yellow,0.5,9.04
totes,golf,plastic,Open only,Green,4.5,9.84
GustBuster,standard,polyester,Open only,Red,1.5,10.13
```

This file is in a popular format named "comma-separated values". Each
item is described by a number of attributes, like its brand, size,
price, etc. The first line (the "header line") of the file names what
each of these attributes is. The rest of the file is one line per
item, each line containing the values of those attributes for the
particular item it represents. The order of the values is consistent
with the order of the attributes in the header line. For example the
first non-header line here lists an umbrella whose price is $8.99,
color is Clear, and brand is Samsonite.

In the inventory file, each item is represented by a string. In the
program, we will be representing the the items as dictionaries. So one
of the important functions you will be writing in this lab is
`load_items(filename)`. In this example, the first non-header line
would become the dictionary `one_umbrella` shown above.

### Representing Search Filter

The structure for representing a search filter is more complex. Here's
a filter that represents "A Samsonite umbrella made of nylon or
plastic":

```python
my_criteria = { 'brand': ['Samsonite'],
    'material': ['nylon', 'plastic'],
}
```

Notice that the keys are still the names of the attributes, but the
values are now *lists* of acceptable descriptions of the umbrella. One
curious thing about this representation is that if a key is absent,
then implicitly any value is acceptable. So for example, any color umbrella
could satisfy `my_criteria`.

In the example above, does `one_umbrella` satisfy `my_criteria` ? No,
it does not. You can see this by checking each of the attributes in
the criteria. First is `brand`. Does `one_umbrella` have an acceptable
brand? Yes. `one_umbrella['brand']` is `'Samsonite'`, which is in the
allowed list `my_criteria[`brand`]`. How about material? Here it
fails. `one_umbrella['material']` is `'polyester'`, but `'polyester'`
is not in the list `['nylon', 'plastic']` (which is
`my_criteria['material']`.

One of the key functions you will write in this project is
`filter_items(criteria, items)`, which takes a list of items (e.g.
umbrellas) and returns a smaller list of just the ones that satisfy
the conditions specified in the dictionary `criteria`.

## Development Strategy

### Milestones

We strongly encourage you to write your program in stages; at the end
of each stage your program must run without error, and deliver an
additional increment of functionality. Here's the suggested list of
development milestones.

1. Program can print the welcome message and action prompt, but
can't actually take any actions. It just states "X not implemented"
for any action the user tries to take. (The starter code described
below gets students to this milestone "for free".)

1. Program can load the inventory of umbrella models from the text
file, and print out a nice representation of the top 10 of them.

1. Program supports the actions `(n)ext` and `(p)revious`, allowing
users to browse through the full inventory of umbrellas.

1. Program supports the `(b)uy` action, allowing users to select one of
the shown models and "purchase" it (simply prints a description of the
selected item and exits).

1. Temporarily hard code the filter `my_criteria` into your program as above.
Program applies that filter to the full inventory and displays just
the subset that match it.

1. Program supports the `(a)dd` filter action, prompting the user for an
attribute and a value, creates a corresponding search criteria
dictionary, and applies it to the inventory (instead of
`my_criteria`, which you can now delete).

1. Program supports the `(r)emove` filter action, displaying the current
attributes that are being filtered on and asking the user which one to
remove.

1. Program supports the `(m)odify` filter action. First it prompts the
user to choose one of the attributes currently being filtered on, then
it prompts the user to toggle (switch from allowed to excluded or
vice-versa) one of the values for that attribute.

### Starter Project

This is a lengthy project, and writing it entirely from scratch in the
time available is fairly challenging. We encourage students to use
[this starter project][1] and extend it as instructed to make a finished
project. Here is a tour of the starter project and a list of parts
that students must implement.

The starter project contains 7 files:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `inventory.csv` | A CSV file containing descriptions of 100+ models of umbrellas |
| `main.py` | Contains the top-level logic of the program, including the action loop and handlers for each action |
| `items.py` | Functions related to representing shopping items as python dictionaries  |
| `criteria.py` | Functions related to search criteria |
| `dictionaries.py` | Utilities for manipulating dictionaries |
| `pages.py` | Functions to help display a paginated list |
| `TEALS_utils.py` | General utilities for many TEALS labs |

Code from 5 of these files is incorporated into `main.py` via `import`
statements at the top of that program. The file `inventory.txt` is
loaded at that start of the main program.

You can run the starter project as-is. It will run without error, but
it won't do much. In order to make it useful, you will have to
implement a number of functions. They are already defined in the
various `.py` files, but have stub implementation that do little besides
announce that they are not yet implemented.

The starter code files also contain some fully implemented functions
that you do not need to change.

Here's a table listing all of the functions present in the starter
code, together with an indication of whether you need to modify them
or not.

| Student must implement? | Function name | File |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| **Yes** | `handle_purchase()` | `main.py` |
| **Yes** | `handle_add_criterion()` | `main.py` |
| **Yes** | `handle_remove_criterion()` | `main.py` |
| **Yes** | `handle_modify_criterion()` | `main.py` |
| **Yes** | `load_items()` | `items.py` |
| **Yes** | `item_to_string()` | `items.py` |
| No      | `print_page()` | `items.py` |
| **Yes** | `filter_items()` | `criteria.py` |
| **Yes** | `criteria_to_string()` | `criteria.py` |
| **Yes** | `union_of_dictionaries()` | `dictionaries.py` |
| No      | `first_index()` | `pages.py` |
| No      | `last_index()` | `pages.py` |
| No      | `next_page_number()` | `pages.py` |
| No      | `previous_page_number()` | `pages.py` |
| No      | `safe_to_integer()` | `TEALS_utils.py` |
| No      | `get_valid_integer()` | `TEALS_utils.py` |

Of course you are free to implement additional functions that you find
useful.

Students will have to decide what is the best order to implement these
functions in; we hope they will be guided by the Milestones listed
above.

### Bonus

You may earn bonus points on the project by trying some of these ideas:

* The current user interface and data representation are pretty poor
  for continuous quantities like price and number. Users typically
  want to add criteria like "price < $X" or "stars > Y". Build this
  feature into your program.
  
* Introduce a "sort by" feature that can list the items by increasing
  / decreasing prices, alphabetically, etc.

* Write a program to generate a random assortment of umbrella models
  and output them as an inventory file in CSV format.

* Update your inventory generator to produce something other than
  umbrellas: smart phones, bicycles, cars, clothing, etc. Update your
  main program in a corresponding way to create a shopping site for a
  different product line.
