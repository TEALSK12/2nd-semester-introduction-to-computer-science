**Introduction to Computer Science - Python Programming**
# Lesson 6.02: Dictionaries Methods

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **pop**, **default value**
* Update values in a dictionary
* Add values to a dictionary
* Remove values from a dictionary

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now]
* [Lab - Word Counter] ([printable lab document]) ([editable lab document])
* Solution (access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard])
* [Associated Reading - section 6.2](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/readings#6-2)
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board.
* Students type code that edits dictionaries by modifying, adding, or removing key:value pairs.

### 2. Lesson

#### Part 1 of the Do Now

* Discuss what the students learned from and go over what the code is doing.
* Describe that you can update a value in a dictionary in a similar way to how you would update a value in a list.

#### Part 2 of the Do Now

* Discuss what the students learned from and go over what the code is doing.
* Note that you can add values to a dictionary by using the same syntax.
* Review: How might you check if a value was in a dictionary before adding it?

#### Part 3 of the Do Now

* Discuss what the students learned from and go over what the code is doing.
* Review what **pop** does, as well as what the second argument does.
* This is the value that will be returned if the first argument is not in the dictionary.

### 3. Lab

* Students will create a word count algorithm that will count the number of words in a list of words.

### 4. Debrief

* Talk about any confusion the students had. Discuss additional ideas of how dictionaries might be useful.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Some students may need to be explicitly reminded of the `in` keyword to check if a certain key is in their dictionary.
