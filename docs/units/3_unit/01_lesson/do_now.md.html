# Do Now 3.01

## In your console

### Type the following code into the editor, then run the program:

```python
    import random
    print(random.randint(0, 3))
    print(random.randint(0, 3))
    print(random.randint(0, 3))
```

## In your notebook

### Respond to the following:

1. What does `randint()` do?
2. What do the values `0` and `3` do? Try changing those numbers and rerun the program.
3. Try typing the same lines above, directly into the Python console, hitting Enter after each line. Is anything different about executing code in interactive mode?
4. What happens if you leave out the `print()` command, and instead just type `random.randint(0, 3)` into the console?
5. What happens differently if you remove `print()` from one or more lines in the original program above, and re-run that? Why does that happen?
