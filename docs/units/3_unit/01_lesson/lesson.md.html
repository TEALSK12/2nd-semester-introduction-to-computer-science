# Lesson 3.01: Built-In Functions

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **function, arguments, calling, importing, returning**.
* Call the built-in `randint` function, using arguments.
* Utilize code other people have written in the Python documentation.
* Understand the difference between printing and returning.

## Materials/Preparation

* [3.01 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/3_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%203.01%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - Magic 8-Ball][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* [Associated Reading](https://tealsk12.github.io/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/readings.md.html#associatedreadings/3.1)
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes  | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Give students 3-4 minutes to follow the instructions on the [Do Now][] page.
* Debrief the answers to the questions on the Do Now by calling on students to respond.

### 2. Lesson

#### Build Your Own Blocks (Snap) vs Functions (Python)

* Ask students to recall how they built custom blocks in Snap!

* **Function**:  a named sequence of statements. You can use functions to perform complex calculations, graphical operations, and various other purposes. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can "**call**" the function by name.
* In SNAP! functions are blocks.

#### Function Contract

A function definition is like a contract: you tell the programmer what elements the function expects (name and type of arguments) and the function will perform its purpose. It is good practice to use a comment to specify the purpose and contract of a function, including the type of value it returns, if it returns a value.

```python
    # Name:
    # Purpose:
    # Arguments:
    # Returns:
```

* Explain that we have already gotten used to **calling** functions like `type()` and `print()`.
* Ask students how they would create a random number generator.
* Sounds hard! Luckily someone has already done that: the random library (essentially a bunch of code written by someone else) which has many associated functions.

#### Back to the Do Now

* Remind students what they saw in the Do Now - how to get a random integer: randint(0, 3).
* Identify the 0 and 3 in this example as **arguments**, or values passed into the function.
* Ask students what the argument is when we use `print` or `type`.
* `randint` gives back a value that you might want to store - this is called **returning**. If nothing is given back, the return value is `None`.

#### More on Function Contracts

* Functions have a contract: you write down the name, purpose, arguments with their type, and the return type expected.
* Ask students what the contract of `randint` is.

```python
    # Name: randint
    # Purpose: generate a pseudo-random integer N such that a <= N <= b
    # Arguments: 2 values of type integer: a and b
    # Returns: integer
```

* Since `randint` is written by someone else there is a place where that contract is written out - **Documentation**. Have students begin the lab, which will instruct them to find the Python documentation for the `random` library.

### 3. Lab

* Students look through `random` library documentation, practice importing different `random` functions and using them.
* Create a Magic 8-Ball program using a list and `randint`.

### 4. Debrief/Exit Ticket

* In their notebooks, have students write down 2 things they learned today to reinforce learning.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, find another library to import from (see **bonus** in the lab) OR allow students to move on to creating their own functions.
