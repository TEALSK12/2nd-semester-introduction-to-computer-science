# Lesson 3.02: User-Defined Functions

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify:
  * abstraction
  * `def` (new Python keyword)
* Create functions
* Create a function contract0

## Materials/Preparation

* [3.02 Slide Deck](https://github.com/Areson/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/3_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%203.02%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - Birthday Song & Random Cards][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* [Associated Reading](https://tealsk12.github.io/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/readings.md.html#associatedreadings/3.2)
* Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* Video Resources:
  * [Intro to Functions](https://youtu.be/nrCAxXfRU28)
  * [Functions Demo](https://youtu.be/C9ZEGqGHXms)

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes  | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students should take 5 minutes to follow the instructions on the Do Now in order to create/manipulate a user-defined function.  

### 2. Lesson

#### Abstraction

* Abstraction is managing the complexity of a program by removing details and pushing them down to a lower level.
* Ask students to brainstorm why a function might be useful in programming.
  * Less repeated code.
  * Breaking the problem up into smaller pieces and solving each piece.

#### Demonstration

* Demonstrate to students how you create a function using `def`, calling out the syntax and where arguments would go.
* Ask students how they would call your example function.
* Have students practice making a function that takes two arguments, adds them together, and returns the sum.

#### Function Contracts

* Introduce the concept of a function contract using `#`, which adds a comment (non-executed line of code).
* The function contract should
  * Specify the name of the function.
  * Explain the purpose of the function.
  * List what arguments it takes in as input, and the types of those arguments.
  * Specify the output return type.

### 3. Lab

* Practice making a function that will take in a name as an argument and output the 'happy birthday song' to that name.
* Create a function that randomly selects 5 cards from a deck of cards (repeating allowed).

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab. Wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, they could go back and use functions to improve an old project.
