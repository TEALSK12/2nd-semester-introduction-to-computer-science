# Lab 3.02 - Birthday Song & Random Cards

## Lab Exercise 1

Create a function, `birthday_song`, that prints out the happy birthday song to whatever name is input as an argument. The contract should be:

  ```python
  # Name: birthday_song
  # Purpose: birthday_song prints out a personalized birthday song
  # Arguments: name, string
  # Returns: none
  def birthday_song(name):
     #your code goes here
  ```

## Lab Exercise 2

* Create a function that randomly picks 5 cards from a deck
* The cards can repeat

 Write out the contract for this function using the list.

```python
number = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K']
```

### Bonus

* Practice passing in lists as an argument to a function.
* What is different about passing in a list as an argument?
* Read about list aliasing in section 3.4 of the associated reading, and write down what is happening in this case.
