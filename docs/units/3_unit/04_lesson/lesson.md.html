# Lesson 3.04: Debugging and Scope

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify **scope**, **aliasing**, **stack diagram**, **stack trace**.
* Demonstrate that changing a list inside a function updates the list outside of the function.
* Demonstrate that updating variables inside a function does **not** affect the variable outside of the function.
* Demonstrate the use of global variables.
* Draw a simple stack diagram.

## Materials/Preparation

* [3.04 Slide Deck](https://github.com/Areson/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/3_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%203.04%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - Aliasing & Scope][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* [Associated Readings 3.4](https://tealsk12.github.io/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/readings.md.html#associatedreadings/3.4)

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students have a chance to think about what & discuss what concepts they have been most challenged by.
* Next, students practice passing a list as an argument and updating that list within the function.

### 2. Lesson

* Discuss what students observed in the Do Now and take time, if needed, to go over questions about concepts that students find challenging.

#### Aliasing

* Explain the concept of **aliasing**.
* You can draw on the board a diagram of the variable pointing to a list.
* Note that when passing the location of a list you are not passing the actual value, so the list can be changed.
* **Video Explanation of Aliasing**:

#### Scope of functions

* Explain to students that variable scope is the part of a program where a variable is accessible.
* A variable which is defined in the main body of a file is called a global variable.

* **Video explanation of Variable Scope**

#### Global Variables, Constants and Local Variables

* Explain global variables are often used for constants.
* Any variable created inside of a function is a local variable.
* Variables in functions include the function parameters, the variables defined in the function, and variables declared as global.
* Local variables of functions can't be accessed from outside when the function call has finished.

#### Conventions

* Discuss that programming languages frequently have **conventions**. It helps make code more readable, but isn't essential to functionality (in most cases).
* Here are some examples:
  * Function and variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
    * [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)
  * Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.
    * [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants)
  
#### Stack Diagrams

* Demonstrate how to draw the Stack Diagrams shown in the course book ([found in section 3.4](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/readings#stack-diagrams)) and explain how they show the scope of variables as they related to functions.
* Point out the error messages that will occur if you use a variable out of its scope.

#### Stack Traces

* Show an example of a stack trace for a simple error in the Do Now Part 2 sample code.
* The error message shows evidence of how Python keeps track a "stack" of functions, each one calling the next one, so that it can make available only the variables that are in scope in the current function.

#### Debugging

* Help students follow their program to understand how the code is working.
* Explain how the use of print statements throughout your code can let you know where in the program things are not operating as expected.

### 3. Lab

* This lab has students running code that gets them thinking about aliasing and scope. They must also create a stack diagram for a program to show their understanding of scope.

### 4. Debrief

* Take time to review the concepts covered today: **scope**, **aliasing**, and **stack diagrams**.
* Call a few students to the board to draw their stack diagrams from the lab and talk through them.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, they can look ahead at the project spec or research the game Oregon Trail for context.
