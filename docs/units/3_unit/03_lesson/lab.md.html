# Lab 3.03 - War (Card Game)

Create a program that lets a user play a **simplified** version of the card game ['War'](http://www.pagat.com/war/war.html).  In this version, the users will share a single deck of cards and cards will not be added back to the deck after they have been played.

## Video Explanation of the Card Game War

![How To Play War (Card Game)](https://youtu.be/yX-jOVer758)

### Your game should

* start with a given shuffled deck variable (shuffle function comes from python's random library, more details below)
* ask for player1 and player2's names.
* have a function `player_turn`, with the contract shown below:

```python
    # Name: player_turn
    # Purpose: takes in a player name,
    #          draws/removes a card from the deck,
    #          prints "user drew card x",
    #          and returns the value
    # Arguments: player_name as string, deck as list
    # Returns: integer
```
* Jacks will be represented as 11, Queens will be represented as 12, Kings will be represented as 13, and Aces will be represented as 14. The suit does not matter.
* Create a function `card_name` to be used by `player_turn()`, that takes in an integer representing a drawn card, and returns a string that names the card. 2 prints as `"2"`, 3 is `"3"`, etc., but 11 is `"J"`, 12 is `"Q"`, 13 is `"K"`, and 14 is `"A"`.
* Make sure to write the contract for card_name()!
* Include a `while` loop that keeps the game running until there are no cards in the deck.
* If there is a tie, there is "war".  Take the next two cards. Whoever wins that comparison gets all four cards (including the previous tied cards).
* If there is another tie, continue taking the next two cards until there a winner.
* The winner takes all the "war" cards.
* Keep track of the score.
* The player who takes the greatest number of cards wins.
* Declare the name of the winner and final score at the end of the game.

### Deck Shuffling

While seemingly simple, shuffling a deck is a somewhat complicated problem. Luckily, Python's random library has a built-in shuffle algorithm. Feel free to read the documentation, but we have provided a simple wrapper function that will return to you a shuffled deck of cards.

```python
    import random

    # Name: shuffled_deck
    # Purpose: will return a shuffled deck to the user
    # Input:
    # Output: a list representing a shuffled deck
    def shuffled_deck():
        basic_deck = list(range(2, 15)) * 4
        random.shuffle(basic_deck)
        return basic_deck
```

### Bonus

Instead of closing the program when the deck is empty, create a way for the user to play again.
