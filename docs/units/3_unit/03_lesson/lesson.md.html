# Lesson 3.03: Return vs Print

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **return, none**
* Explain and demonstrate the difference between printing and returning

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - War (Card Game)][] ([printable lab document][]) ([editable lab document][])

* [Associated Reading - section 3.3](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/readings#3-3)
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* Note that this lesson may take two days.

## Day 1 Pacing

| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief  |

## Day 2 Pacing

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 40 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief  |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students experiment with a function that returns a value, but they must add a print command to output that value.

### 2. Lesson

* Ask students about what they think the difference between returning and printing is.

#### Student Sharing

* Get a volunteer to describe how they rewrote the code in the Do Now to get a value output.
* Ask a student to write the code on the board.

#### Discussion

* Discuss the concept of the function contract again, explaining that the functions we will work with have both inputs and outputs.
* Returning is a concept in Snap!, just with a different name: reporting.

#### Building a Structure Activity

1. One student volunteer represents the `give_card` function.
2. This students holds the deck of cards and stands by the board.
3. On the board display the `give_card` function in code code that only **prints** the value of a randomly chosen card.
4. Students 'call' the student and request cards, which then the student follows the instructions and draws ('prints') the card on the board.
5. Display a new `give_card` function that **returns** a card instead.
6. Have students 'call' the function, however this time have the `give_card` student pass out the card when a student calls him/her.
7. * Debrief the activity and talk about what was learned.

### 3. Lab

* Given a shuffled deck list, students will create a program that plays the game 'War' with the user.

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

As an extension activity, ask students to research the shuffle function and the functions associated with it.
