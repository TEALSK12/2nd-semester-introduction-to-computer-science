# Lesson 4.06: Tic Tac Toe

## Learning objectives

Students will be able to...

* Use project planning skills to complete a larger project.
* Utilize loops, lists, and nested loops/lists to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Materials/preparation

* [4.06 Slide deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/4_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%204.06%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Project spec - Tic-Tac-Toe][] ([docx][1]) ([pdf][2])
  * [Teacher's guide for BC curriculum alignment](project_canada.md.html)
* [Project Spec - 2 Player Tic-Tac-Toe][] ([docx][3]) ([pdf][4])
* [Tic Tac Toe starter code](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/4_unit/06_lesson/tictactoe_starter_code.py)
* Solution (Protected content such as unit quizzes, quiz answer keys, project sample solutions are available to those with a TEALS Dashboard account. Please email info@tealsk12.org for access information)
* Read through the handout, lesson, and project so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students
* Try creating your own variation on the Tic-Tac-Toe game so you are familiar with the potential challenges and bugs your students will hit
* Review [4 steps to solve any CS problem][]
* [Editable grading rubric](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/4_unit/06_lesson/rubric.docx)

## Instructor's note

### 1. Do now

* Hand out the project spec and have students start reading through it.

### 2. Project overview

* Demo the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
* Go over all of the game rules and program requirements.

### 3. Planning/design

#### Have students do the following in their notebook

* Write down the 4 steps to solve any CS problem from memory.
* Draw out game play and consider the overall design.
  * How will they represent the board?
  * How will they have users input their spots?
  * What functions will be needed to handle each user interaction?  
  * What variables will be needed?

#### Have students plan out their next several days (suggested plan below)

1. Set up the game board. Code the basic game loop asking players for input. Avoid code duplication:  use the same code to handle the two different players.
2. Create variables necessary to run the game. Start implementing basic functions.
3. Focus on game play: 2 players should be able to play a game against each other.
4. Create functions for checking if the game is over. Create a horizontal checker, vertical checker, and diagonal checkers.
5. Connect the functions together and test functionality.
6. Use multiple tests to check for different game-over conditions. Finalize project.

### 4. Debrief

* Take time to go over questions and confusion relating to project requirements.
* Make sure to look over individual student project plans and check that they have outlined the project in a way that makes sense.

### 5. Daily plan

* At the start of Days 2-9, have each student refer to their original project plan, write down what they hope to accomplish that day, and assess their schedule to see if they are on track.

### 6. Review

* Go over any parts of the program that the majority of the class is struggling with.
* Provide scaffolding and tips to students that are not on track for completion.

## Accommodation/differentiation

* Students can create a variable-sized board.
* The checkers can actually be done using one function, taking in starting x and y values and the change in x and y at each step.
* The planning phase of this project will be essential, especially for students who you think may struggle with this project.
* Provide more guidance and scaffolding to those students that need it.
