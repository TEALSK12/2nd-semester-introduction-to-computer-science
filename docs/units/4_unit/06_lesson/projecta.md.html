# Alternate Project 4: Tic-Tac-Toe

Modified by Brian Weinfeld

Using loops, variables and functions in Python, you will create a Tic-Tac-Toe game for two human players.

## Overview

[Tic-Tac-Toe](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tic-tac-toe) is a game in which one player draws X's and another player draws O's inside a set of nine squares. Each player tries to be the first to fill a row, column, or diagonal of squares with either X's or O's.

### Behavior

There are many ways to display a Tic-Tac-Toe board. Include labels or initial `print` statements so that new players can clearly understand how the rows and columns are numbered (e.g., 0 through 2, or 1 through 3).

The sample run below shows one possible display method. This can be modified as needed.

```
Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!
'X' what is your name? Alice
'O' what is your name? Bob
Game Start
  1|2|3
1  | |
2  | |
3  | |

Alice, what row is your move? 2
Alice, what col is your move? 2
  1|2|3
1  | |
2  |X|
3  | |

Bob, what row is your move? 1
Bob, what col is your move? 1
  1|2|3
1 O| |
2  |X|
3  | |

Alice, what row is your move? 3
Alice, what col is your move? 1
  1|2|3
1 O| |
2  |X|
3 X| |

Bob, what row is your move? 3
Bob, what col is your move? 1
Invalid move. Try again.

Bob, what row is your move? 4
Bob, what col is your move? 4
Invalid move. Try again.

Bob, what row is your move? 1
Bob, what col is your move? 2
  1|2|3
1 O|O|
2  |X|
3 X| |

Alice, what row is your move? 1
Alice, what col is your move? 3
  1|2|3
1 O|O|X
2  |X|
3 X| |

X wins!

Would you like to play again? no
Goodbye
```

### Implementation Details

The game board should be stored in a list of lists. Each of the internal lists represents one row of the game board. If the element in the list is the empty string (the empty string is ''), then the spot is unoccupied. If the element in the list is an 'X' or an 'O', then it is occupied by that player.

Begin by completing the functions below. Do your best to ensure that each function works properly before moving on to the next part of the project.

```python
    def print_board(game_board):
        # add your code here
```

* print_board takes the game board as its only parameter. This function nicely prints the game board.

```python
    def check_winner(game_board):
        # add your code here
```

* check_winner uses the game board to check whether or not a player has won. Return 'X' or 'O' if either of those players have won the game and None if neither player has won.

```python
    def check_tied(game_board):
        # add your code here
```

* check_tied is used to determine whether the game is tied (all 9 spaces are filled but no one has won). Return True if the game is tied and False if it has not.

```python
    def make_move(game_board, name, symbol):
        # add your code here
```

* make_move is used to fill the game board with the current player's move. The name parameter is a string representing the current player's name and symbol is a string representing their game symbol ('X' or 'O'). Prompt the user by their name for a row and column and place their symbol in the indicated spot. If they select an illegal spot, prompt them for a new selection.

### Integration and Testing

After completing and testing the above functions, complete the following steps to create the main game loop.

* Prompt the 'X' player and 'O' player for their names. You can use these names to prompt each player for their move.
* Start by printing an empty game board as the starting point.
* The players will take turns making moves utilizing the make_move function.
* At the end of each player's turn the program will:
  * check if that player has won using the check_winner function.
  * print the updated game board using the print_board function.
* If there are no more spots open and nobody has won the game, the program will print 'Tie game!'. Check this using the check_tied function.
* After the game is over, prompt the players if they would like to play again or quit.

### Challenge

* Going first is a big advantage in this game. Modify your game loop so that if the users indicate they want to play again, the players swap who goes first. The players should keep their symbol ('X' or 'O') but the symbol that goes first should swap. Every time the players replay the game, the player who goes first should swap.

* Instead of a single game, some players may want to play a best-of-5 or best-of-7 series. In such an event, players repeatedly play the game until one player has won a majority of the games in the series. Before the first game is played, prompt the players for the best-of series they want to play. Remember you don't need to play unnecessary games. If 'X' wins the first 3 games in a best-of-5, the last two games don't need to be played. You should still prompt the players to see if they want to play again (that is, play a new series of games).

### Super Challenge

The super challenge will require knowledge that has not been taught yet. You will need to do additional research on your own. Good luck!

* Modify the game loop so that instead of two human players, either (or both) of the players can be computers. The computer's names can be some variation on "Computer 1". Modify the make_move function so that computer can make an automatic selection. To begin, simply have the computer randomly select an available empty space for its move.

* Continue to build on the above challenge by giving the computer some basic game logic. If the other player is about to win (ie: they have two in a row), then the computer should always select the blocking move. What kind of logic can you give the computer for its turn if it doesn't have to make a blocking move?
