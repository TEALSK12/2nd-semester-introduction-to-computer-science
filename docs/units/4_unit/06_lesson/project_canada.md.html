# Project 4: Tic-Tac-Toe

Using Python, students will create a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project has 3 parts:

1. Designing the game so that two users can play Tic-Tac-Toe against one another.
2. Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe checker which will check the board to see if Xs or Os have won the game.
3. Enhancement:  replacing the Xs and 0s with two other characters, within another context!

## Overview

[Tic-Tac-Toe](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tic-tac-toe) is a game in which one player draws X's and another player draws O's inside a set of nine squares and each player tries to be the first to fill a row, column, or diagonal of squares with either X's or O's. We will be writing an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe program. At the end of each turn the computer will check to see if X's have won the game or if the O's have won the game.

### Behavior

* The program will prompt the user to enter their name and their opponents name.
* Whoever enters their name first will be playing as X's, and the other player will be O's.
* The players will take turns inputting the row and column they would like to place their mark.
* If that spot is already taken the program will ask for the spot again.
* At the end of each player's turn the program will check if that player has won.
* At the end of each player's turn the program will print the updated game board.
* If there are no more spots open and nobody has won the game, the program will print `Tie game!`.

### Implementation Details

* Use variables to store the user names for personalized prompts.
* Create a game board represented as a list of lists, size 3 by 3.
***Note: This is a change from our earlier implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe. Why do you think this might be better?***
* Check for a winner horizontally, vertically, and on both diagonals.
* Cannot allow a user to overwrite a spot on the board.
* Use a constant value for the "X", and "O" character (so that future enhancements are easy!  See below.)

### Testing

* Create a document called a "test plan" to list out how you will test your game.
* This should include all the test cases related to game play.
* Before you "deliver" (or submit) your game, you should go through all the items on your test plan.
* Ask yourself:  As a User, what should they be able to do?  What is their goal?  What are the possible inputs?
* A helpful template is this sentence:  "As a User, I want to ..., so that I can ..."
* A test plan should include going through all the goals/tasks, and see if they are achieved.
* A test plan should include trying bad, or un-intended, input.  How does your game respond?

#### BC ADST Computer Programming 11 Curriculum Competencies - Applied Design, Testing

In this project, we are creating a familiar game.  Nonetheless, it is wise to create a test plan, even before implementation begins.
As the students progress, they should refer back to their plan to stay focussed on tasks/features of the game.

Software developers aim to have "something" working at the end of each iteration (or sprint).  In other words,
some item in the test plan has been tested successfully.   At the end of an iteration / milestone, consider inviting peers
(or family and friends) to try out your game, even if not everything is working yet.  In the process, developers can gain
insight and feedback to help their next iteration.   User testing and feedback that is woven into the subsequent iteration is core
to a successful agile project management process.

Have a game day party!  Invite others to come to your classroom.  Send your game to friends.  Create a few user experience survey
questions to gather from anyone, and everyone, who plays your game.   Ask questions related to anything that may help your
next iteration:  colour, size, font, layout, game play, words of encouragement (or lack of!), intuitiveness, and so on.

### Enhancements

* Now that you have a basic version created, how can it be made unique?
* Consider aspects that the design that be changed so that the game can have a fresh look/feel?
* Consider context that is relevant to your community, or daily life.  
* Consider alternatives to X's and O's, for example:
  * If you live by the West Coast, you can use:  B (beach) or M (mountain)
    * If you have second language learners, you can use foreign language characters, such as: 是 (yes) 否 (no)
    * If you are into emoticons, you can use:  😍 or  😭
    * Find two animals that are treasured by the First Peoples communities in your area.

A simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe can bring on new life when applied to a new context.  
It can be used to bring awareness to current issues or interests in our daily life.
Aside from the entertainment value associated with the game, software enables use to communicate other purpose and intentions.
Be creative!

Characters we see on the screen (console) are simply digital encodings of 0's and 1's.  
When we print characters in Python or any other language, we are using the ascii
or unicode encodings.  Students can explore and use these codes in their Python print statement.  Emojis: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-print-emojis/

### Challenge  

* Implement "fairness".  Going first is a big advantage in this game. Modify your game loop so that if the users indicate they want to play again, the players swap who goes first. The players should keep their symbol ('X' or 'O') but the symbol that goes first should swap. Every time the players replay the game, the player who goes first should swap.

* Implement a Tournament.  Instead of a single game, some players may want to play a best-of-5 or best-of-7 series. In such an event, players repeatedly play the game until one player has won a majority of the games in the series. Before the first game is played, prompt the players for the best-of series they want to play. Remember you don't need to play unnecessary games. If 'X' wins the first 3 games in a best-of-5, the last two games don't need to be played. You should still prompt the player's to see if they want to play again (that is, play a new series of games).

* In your classroom hold a Live Tournament.  Keep a record of tournament details such as:  games played, and wins and losses.   In groups, reflect on the design of the game in terms of:  usability, fairness, strategy.   How can some shortcomings, or mistakes, be improved or fixed to improve this simple game?   What might be a good target audience for this game?

The goal of fairness is interesting in game design.  Discuss these questions with students:  Should game design be fair?  What does fairness mean?  Brainstorm ways in which a game can be "fair"?

To develop the "take turns to start" strategy, or the "tournament" feature described above, begin with designing the logic with pen and paper first:  sketch a flow chart, write the pseudocode.  Have students (in partners) examine each other's design logic before implementing anything in Python code.  Create a test plan with a variety of inputs and expected output.  Have all possibilities been considered?  Is the logic solid?  

Finally, have a tournament day!   Aside from having fun, also gather data from game play to reflect on the validity of your design.  How can things be fixed or improved?  What are some strengths and weaknesses of your design?

### Super Challenge - Building an AI algorithm

The super challenge will require knowledge that has not been taught yet. You will need to do additional research on your own. Good luck!

* Modify the game loop so that instead of two human players, either (or both) of the players can be computers. The computer's names can be some variation on "Computer 1". Modify the make_move function so that computer can make an automatic selection. To begin, simply have the computer randomly select an available empty space for their move.

* Continue to build on the above challenge by giving the computer some basic game logic. If the other player is about to win (i.e.: they have two in a row), then the computer should always select the blocking move. What kind of logic can you give the computer for its turn if it doesn't have to make a blocking move?

#### BC Mathematics 11 Computer Science Big Ideas - Algorithms, Computational Thinking, Problem Solving

Artificial intelligence begins with imagining what a human being would do.  
At each move:

* What goes through the mind of a player?
* What are the considerations and possible steps that a player at take?
* Which sequence of upcoming steps would lead to a winning situation?

Sketch the decision tree to represent your proposed algorithm.  Do your logic design with pen and paper first (flow chart and pseudocode).
Finally, have peer testing, have a class tournament, and reflect together on the the game logic.   Was the computer as good as a human?
