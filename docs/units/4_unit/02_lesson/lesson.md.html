# Lesson 4.02: For Loops Using Range

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **range**
* Use the `range` and `len` function to to update lists via for loops

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - Getting Loopy][] ([printable lab document][]) ([editable lab document][])

* [Associated Reading - section 4.2 of Book](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/readings#4-2)
* Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 35 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board.
* Students experiment with and are introduced to the `range` function.

### 2. Lesson

#### Part 1 of the Do Now

* Ask students what the **range** function did.
* Remind them that there are reference docs online.
* Show the docs for the range function (note that it actually takes in a third value that is optional).
* Work together with the students to write a for loop just using the range function.

#### Part 2 of the Do Now

* Ask the students what happened
* Ask the students why these values might be helpful
* They are a list of the indices!

#### Part 3 (many students likely didn't finish)

* Ask students to write the first line of the loop on the board
* Work together as a class to come to a solution that is demonstrated for all to see.

### 3. Lab

* Students re-write the fruit pluralize program from yesterday's do now, but without creating a new list.
* Students write a function that reverses the letters in a string.

### 4. Debrief

* Talk about any issues the students had with the lab today.
* Discuss how lists are mutable, so you don't have to return a new value. Instead, the list is just updated as the loop runs.

#### Video explanation on Python Lists being Mutable

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* If students are having a hard time with the fruit pluralize, consider altering the fruit program to not allow fruit that ends in y.
* Some students may have issues with grabbing the last item of a string, consider providing tips or scaffolding for students that are struggling with this.
* Go over the bonus question if any students got to it. Discuss having a function inside of the loop and how that operated.
