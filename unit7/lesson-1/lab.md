# Lab 7.02

In this lab we will create a Pet class that will keep track of the type of animal, color, food, noise and name of a given animal.

1. Create a class called Pet that has the following attributes: 
   * Animal \(i.e. dog, cat, fish\)
   * Color \(i.e. spotted, black, tabby, white\)
   * Food \(i.e. kibbles, tuna, fish flakes\)
   * Noise \(i.e. meow, woof, bark\)
   * Name \(i.e. Sparky, Scooby Doo\)
2. Make sure to use the `__init__` method to create these attributes.
3. Create a list of pets.
4. Create a function that takes in a list of pets and prints out the name and the food attributes.
5. Test your function with your list of pets.
