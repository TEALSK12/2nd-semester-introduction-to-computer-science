1. Read through the following code: 

```python
my_pet_1 = 'pet'
my_pet_1_type = 'cat'
my_pet_1_noise = 'meow'
my_pet_1_full_name = 'Snuffles McGruff'

my_pet_2 = 'pet'
my_pet_2_type = 'cat'
my_pet_2_noise = 'meow'
my_pet_2_full_name = 'Snowpounce Flury'

my_pet_3 = 'pet'
my_pet_3_type = 'cat'
my_pet_3_noise = 'meow'
my_pet_3_full_name = 'Snickers Snorkel'

my_pets = [my_pet_1, my_pet_2, my_pet_3]
for pet in my_pets: 
    ## print full name of each pet
```

In the above code, write a quick description of how you would print out each of the pet's names.

Write down some other data structures you could use to make this easier.
