# Lesson 2.03: Booleans & Expressions

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: evaluating, expressions, True, False
* Evaluate a boolean expression
* Compose boolean expressions using and, or, not, <, >, == 

##Materials/Preperation
* [Do Now Handout]
* Read through the handout, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note
1. Have students work on the Do Now part 1
2. Lesson
  1. Ask students what they thought a Boolean was? 
    1. If students are struggling. Ask them what values they saw? (answer should be True or False) 
    2. Boolean expression: is an expression that evaluates to either true or false.
  1. Ask Students about the difference between `=` and `==`. 
    1. = is a setter for variables 
    2. == builds a boolean expression
  2. Show Students boolean expressons in SNAP.

  3. Give a little bit of time for the students to do finish complementing part 2 of the assignment 
  4. Have a student write up the expression they used to update the `can_get_license` code.
    1.Poll students- how many boolean expressions are used? Answers here can vary but ~7 (age >= 16, age <18, driving_with_permit >=6, and expression, age > 18, or expression, whole expression) 
    2. Define composition: Using an expression as part of a larger expression, or a statement as part of a larger statement.
  5. Besides `and`, there is `or` and `not` as well as `!=` which means does not equal. 
3. Lab
    1. Convert old snap code into Python code
    2. Evaluate expressions with `and`, `or`, and `not`
    2. Given written out rules, and turn them into Booleans
    3. Create a large expression using variables that describes you. 
4. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, it is possible to introduce the concepts of booleans here. Discuss how students would represent binary (0s and 1s). In practice these translate to True and False. Convert numbers to boolean, and booleans to number.
