* Use a while list to simulate game play

##Materials/Preperation
* [Do Now Handout]
* [Lab]
* Read through the handout, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Ask students what the while loop did?
    3. What does `remove` do? What does `pop` do? What were the differences. 
    4. Ask students what the plus sign does? What does append do? What would happen if you did `append([1, 2, 3])`?
    5. Nested List: a list that is contained within another list. Only counts as 1 element
        1. Ask Students the length of this nested list? 
        2. Ask students how would we get the length of the inner list
    6. Asks students to write down how they would represent a tic-tac-toe board using lists. Create a tic-tac-toe board with students in class. 
2. Lab
    1. Have students practice slicing, adding, removing elements from some given lists. 
    2. Tic-Tac-toe 9 moves 
3. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, start topic of while loop as the game loop 
    2. Keeping score for game
