# Lab 2.04

1\) Follow the flow of execution in the following programs and predict what will happen for each one:

```python
    a = 100
    b = 7
    if a > 85 and b > 7:
        print("Stellar Grade")
    elif a <= 85 and b <= 7: 
        print("okay grade")
    else: 
        print("pretty good grade")
```

```python
    a = input("What... is your quest") 
    b = "to seek the holy grail"
    if a != b: 
        print("Go On. Off you go") 
    else: 
        b = input("What...is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?")
        if b == "What do you mean? An African or European swallow?": 
            print("I don't know that...AHHH [Bridgekeeper was thrown over bridge]")
        else: 
            print("[you were thrown over bridge]")
```

```python
    user_input = input("What is your favorite color"): 
    if user_input == 'blue': 
        print("Blueskadoo")
    elif user_input == "red": 
        print("Roses are red!")
    elif user_input == "yellow": 
        print("Mellow Yellow")
    elif user_input == "green": 
        print("Green Machine")
    elif user_input == "orange": 
        print("Orange you glad I didn't say banana.") 
    elif user_input == "black": 
        print("I see a red door and I want it painted black")
    elif user_input == "purple": 
        print("And we'll never be royalllssss")
    elif user_input == "pink": 
        print("Pinky- and the Brain")
    else: 
        print("I don't recognize that color. Is it even...??")
```

2\) Translate this Snap! program into a Python program. ![triangle\_program](../../.gitbook/assets/triangle_program.png)

3\) Create a game show program!

* Declare 10 prizes \(prize1, prize2, prize 3 at the top of your file\)
* User picks a number
* The prize corresponding with that door is printed for the user. 

## Bonus!

Research lists in Python. Re-implement problem 3 using lists.
