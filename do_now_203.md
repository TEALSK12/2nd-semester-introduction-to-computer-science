Open up the terminal. Type the following code into the interactive editor. 
```
 >>> 5 < 3
 >>> 5 > 3
 >>> "cats" == "dogs"
 >>> my_favorite_animal = "cats"
 >>> my_favorite_animal == "cats"
 >>> months_with_driving_permit = 6
 >>> age = 16
 >>> can_get_license = months_with_driving_permit >= 6 and age >= 16
 >>> print(can_get_license) 
 
```
What does `5 < 3` evaluate to? Try using `type` on `5<3`? What do you think a boolean is? 
<br>
<br>
<br>

What is the difference between `==` and `=` ?
