## Instructor's Notes

### 1. 4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem

* Review [4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem]

### 2. Project Overview/Demo

* Distribute the project spec to all students and walk them through the goals and requirements of the project.
* Show a demo of a completed project.
* Go over specific design considerations from the project spec:
* Introduce the concept of global variables and how they will be useful here.
* Identify the importance of the "User Pocket" and how to use a list along with `append` and `remove` for this information.

### 3. Design

* Have students stay at their desks and write down what lists they'll need.
* They should break up the project into parts: parsing user input, keeping track of players position, returning what is at the player's position .

### 4. Debrief/Review

* During discussion and warp up at the end of class, get a feeling for where students are in the project.
* During the review the next morning cover the topics/areas that students are struggling on and present tips, suggestions, and goals for that day.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* Make sure to do status checks with all students throughout the project.
* Identify students that are struggling on the project after the first few days and provide additional scaffolding & support as needed.
* For any students that are advancing rapidly through the project, give them extension ideas such as adding a new feature or floor to the game.
* Advanced students can also be paired as tutors/helpers with struggling students.

## Grading

### Objective Scoring Breakdown
[Editable Grading Rubric](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/2_unit/07_lesson/rubric.docx)

Student correctly identifies data types (Lesson 2.01) - Assessed in Unit 3

| Points | Percentage| Objective | Lesson |
| :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| 3 | 12% | Student correctly uses conditionals to maintain flow of control|2.02, 2.03 |
| 9 | 36% | Student correctly uses lists | 2.04 2.05 |
| 3 | 12% | Student can correctly use the while loop | 2.06 |
| 5 | 20% | Student can decompose a problem to create a program from a brief | |
| 5 | 20% | Student uses naming/ syntax conventions and comments to increase readability | |
| 25 | | Total | |

### Scoring Consideration

You may need to adjust the points in order to fit your class. Treat the percentages as a guide to determine how to weight the objectives being assessed.
