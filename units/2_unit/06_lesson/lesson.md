## Instructor's Notes
### 1. Do Now
 * Students may need more time than usual to fully go through this lesson's Do Now.
### 2. Lesson
#### Lecture
 * Ask students what doing `a[0:2]` in the Do Now did.
 * Define **slicing**: a list operation that gives back a list starting from the index to the left of the colon and going up to the index to the right of the colon. 
 * Note that slicing doesn't exist in Snap!
#### Discussion
 * Ask students what the list would return if you did `a[1:2]`.
 * Explore the differences between `remove` and `pop`, asking for student input. 
 * Ask students what the plus sign and `append` do to a list.
#### Ideation Activiy
 * Ask students to write down or brainstorm how they would represent a Tic-Tac-Toe board using lists.
 * Create a Tic-Tac-Toe board with students in class. 
### 3. Lab
    * Students practice slicing, adding, and removing elements from some given lists. 
    * Students create a single move Tic-Tac-Toe game
### 4. Debrief
    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation
* If students are moving quickly, start the next topic of using a while loop as a game loop. Explore the concept of keeping score for the game.
* If students are moving slowly then spend an extra day reviewing lists and completing lab activities. 

## Quiz Option
There is also an opportunity for a quiz after the game loop lesson and before the project.
