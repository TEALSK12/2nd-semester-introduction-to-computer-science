# Lab 2.06 - Tic-Tac-Toe Revisited

## Implement the Tic Tac Toe game using a single list

Create this game again using lists and indexes. Updated rules are below.

* Allow users to keep playing (max 9 times).

* Print the diagram before play begins:

```
     1 | 2 | 3  
    -----------
     4 | 5 | 6  
    -----------
     7 | 8 | 9
```

* Use variables to decide whose turn it is. Greet the players as "X's" or "O's".
* User picks a location on the board by entering a number.
* Depending on the location that the user chose, update the corresponding board position.
* Print the updated board out.
* You will not need to determine the winner at this point.

### Bonus

There are eight possible ways to win a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

* After each turn in the game, check to see if the most recent player has won the game.
* Print appropriate messages if the X's player wins, or if the O's player wins.
* If no one has won the game after 9 moves, declare the game to be a draw.
