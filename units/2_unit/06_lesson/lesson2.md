## Instructor's Notes
1. Do Now
    * Students experiment and learn that if they want to find out if a particular element is in a list, there is a useful tool that can save time.
2. Lesson
  * Go over list `is in` conditionals. Ask what the return value is (Boolean expression).
    * Have students practice using the `is in` in an if statement. User this time to look over the student responses to the first part of the Do Now - identify the topics they are having problems with.
3. Review
    * Spend time reviewing the topics students are confused about.
    * Have students practice using lists and Boolean expressions.

###Accommodation/Differentiation 
This lesson may not be necessary, however this is a good opportunity to check for student understanding of lists and associated functions. 

There could also be a unit quiz after the game loop lesson or during the Zork project, and this lesson could be used to review for that quiz.
