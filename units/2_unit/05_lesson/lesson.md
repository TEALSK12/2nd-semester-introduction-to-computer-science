# Lesson 2.05: Lists Part 2

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **index, slice, append, pop, remove**.
* Slice a list.
* Add and remove elements from a list.

## Materials/Preparation

* [2.05 Slide Deck](https://github.com/Areson/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/2_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%202.05%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - Tic-Tac-Toe][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* [Associated Readings 2.5](https://tealsk12.github.io/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/readings.md#associatedreadings/2.5)
* Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 10 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 30 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief  |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students may need more time than usual to fully go through this lesson's Do Now.

### 2. Lesson

#### Instruction

* Ask students what doing `a[0:2]` in the Do Now did.
* Define **slicing**: a list operation that gives back a list starting from the index to the left of the colon and going up to (but not including) the index to the right of the colon.
* Ask students what the list would return if you did `a[1:2]`.
* Explore the differences between `remove` and `pop`, asking for student input.
* Ask students what the plus sign and `append` do to a list.
* Ask students to write down or brainstorm how they would represent a Tic-Tac-Toe board using lists.
* Go over the list `in` operation. Ask what the return value is (Boolean expression).
* Have students practice using the `in` operation in an if statement.

#### Demonstration

* Create a Tic-Tac-Toe board with students in class.

### 3. Lab

* Students practice slicing, adding, and removing elements from some given lists.
* Students create a single move Tic-Tac-Toe game.

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* If students are moving quickly, start the next topic of using a while loop as a game loop. Explore the concept of keeping score for the game.
* If students are moving slowly then spend an extra day reviewing lists and completing lab activities.

## Quiz Option

There is also an opportunity for a quiz after the game loop lesson and before the project.
