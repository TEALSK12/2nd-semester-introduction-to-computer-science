We will have a quiz next class covering all of the above topics. 

### Discussion
Is there any topic you would like to focus on and cover more of?

### In your Notebook
-----------------------
Rank the following from easiest to hardest: 

1. Importing built-in functions
2. Using `randint`
3. Abstraction/creating functions
4. Passing int/str/float/bool arguments into functions
5. Calling a function 
6. List syntax
7. Return vs print 

### Type the following into the console: 

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# input: a list of strings
# output: None
def my_function(list_argument): 
	list_argument[0] = 'z'
print(my_list)
my_function(my_list)
print(my_list)
```
1. What did the program output and what is this program doing?

### Bonus
-------------
Try writing a similar program but passing in integers instead of a list. What happens?
