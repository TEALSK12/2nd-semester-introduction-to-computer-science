# Lab 3.03 - War (Card Game)

1) Create a program that lets a user play the card game 'War'. 

Game should: 

* ask for player1 and player2's names
* given a shuffled deck variable 
* have a function player_turn

```python
#player_turn: takes in a player name, player_name, and draws/removes a card from the deck, prints "user drew card x", and returns the value 
#input: player_name, string 
#output: string
```
* have a function compare_scores that takes in the two strings and compares the card value. write the contract for compare_scores
* put game in a while loop until there are no cards in the deck
* keep track of the score
* at the end print the winner


compare: 

###Bonus!
Instead of closing the program. Create a way for the user to play again.
