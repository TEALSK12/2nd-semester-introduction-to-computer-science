# Lab 3.03 - Calculator

Create a program that lets a user perform calculations on two numbers

The program should:
* As the user for input about what operation they want to perform
* The operators that the user can use are `“+”`, `“-”`, `“/”`, and `“*”` (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
* The contract for the function should be 
  ```python
  calculator(num1, num2, operator)
  ```
* The function should return the result of the calculation, which you should print for the user to see
