# Lesson 3.03: Return vs Print

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **return, none, void**
* Explain and demonstrate the difference between printing and returning

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab] - War (Card Game)
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* Note that this lesson may take two days.

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
    * Students experiment with a function that returns a value, but they must add a print command to output that value. 
2. **Lesson**
    * Ask students about what they think the difference between returning and printing is. 
        * Get a volunteer to describe how they rewrote the code in the Do Now to get a value output.
        * Ask a student to write the code on the board. 
    * Discuss the concept of the function contract again, explaining that the functions we will work with have both inputs and outputs.
    * Returning is a concept in Snap!, just with a different name: reporting.

    * If students appear to be struggling with the return vs. print concept, try this activity: 
        * Students work together to build a structure using cards. One student volunteer represents the `give_card` function. This students holds the deck of cards and stands by the board. 
        * On the board display the `give_card` function in code code that only **prints** the value of a randomly chosen card. Students 'call' the student and request cards, which then the student follows the instructions and draws ('prints') the card on the board.
        * Next display a new `give_card` function that **returns** a card instead. Have students 'call' the function, however this time have the `give_card` student pass out the card when a student calls him/her. 
    	* Debrief the activity and talk about what was learned. 
3. **Lab**
    * Given a shuffled deck list, students will create a program that plays the game 'War' with the user. 
    
4. **Debrief**
    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.


###Accommodation/Differentiation
As an extension activity, ask students to research the shuffle function and the functions associated with it.
