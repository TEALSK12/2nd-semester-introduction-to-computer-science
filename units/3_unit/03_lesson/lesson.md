* [Do Now]
* [Lab] - War (Card Game)
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* Note that this lesson may take two days.

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
    * Students experiment with a function that returns a value, but they must add a print command to output that value. 
2. **Lesson**
    1. Ask: What does returning do? What does printing do? 
        1. How did you rewrite the code
        2. Ask a student to write the code on the board. 
    2. Rediscuss the contract. Now have outputs as well as inputs 
    3. If students are struggling run an activity: 
        1. Have students build a structure using cards. One student is the give_card function. This students holds the deck of cards and stands by the board. 
        2. On board display function in pseudo code that just prints the value. Students call the student and request cards. Have the student draw the card on the board or write 4Spades on the board
        3. Next display a function that returns. Have students call function. This time have the student pass out the cards when it is called. 
    	4. Debrief the activity and talk about what was learned 
3. **Lab**
    * Given a shuffled deck, create a program that plays the game 'War'.  


###Accommodation/Differentiation
As an extension activity, ask students to research the deal function and the functions associated with it.
