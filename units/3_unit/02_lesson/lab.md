# Lab 3.02 - Birthday Song & Random Cards

## Lab Exercise 1

Create a function, `birthday_song`, that prints out the happy birthday song to whatever name is input as an argument. The contract should be:

```python
    # Name: birthday_song
    # Purpose: birthday_song prints out a personalized birthday song
    # Input: name, string
    # Output: none
    def birthday_song(name):
        # your code goes here
```

## Lab Exercise 2

* Create a function that adds two numbers.

Write out the contract for `add(num1, num2)` function. The function should _print_ the sum of the two numbers.

### Bonus
* Try taking what you learned making the `add` function and make a calculator.

* The contract should look like:
```python
calculator(num1, num2, operator)
```

The `operator` argument is a string that can be either `"+"` or `"-"` and determines what the calculator does.

* The function should print the result of the calculation.
