## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Ask students why a function is useful?
  	1. Abstraction
  	2. less repeated code
  	3. Consolidation of understanding
  2. How do you create a function
  	1. go over the syntax,
  	2. arguments
  3. Ask students how they would call the function, what about a function that takes in arguments
  4. Have students practice making a function that takes arguments and sum them. Saving both the variables as the sum in the function. 
  5. Introduce concept of a function contract. Using `#` which adds a comment (non executed line to code)
  	1. explain what the function will do, arguemtns it takes in (and their types)
2. Lab
    1. Practice making a function that will take in a name, and sing 'happy birthday' to that name. 
    2. Create a function that randomly selects 5 cards from a deck of cards (repeating allowed)
3. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, they could go back and use functions in an old project
