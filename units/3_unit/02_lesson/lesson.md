# Lesson 3.02: User-Defined Functions

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify:
  * abstraction
  * `def` (new Python keyword)
* Create functions
* Create a function contract

## Materials/Preparation

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students should take 5 minutes to follow the instructions on the Do Now in order to create/manipulate a user-defined function.  

### 2. Lesson

#### Abstraction

* Abstraction is managing the complexity of a program by removing details and pushing them down to a lower level.
* Ask students to brainstorm why a function might be useful in programming.
  * Less repeated code.
  * Breaking the problem up into smaller pieces and solving each piece.

#### Demonstration

* Demonstrate to students how you create a function using `def`, calling out the syntax and where arguments would go.
* Ask students how they would call your example function.
* Have students practice making a function that takes two arguments, adds them together, and returns the sum.

#### Function Contracts

* Introduce the concept of a function contract using `#`, which adds a comment (non-executed line of code).
* The function contract should
  * Specify the name of the function.
  * Explain the purpose of the function.
  * List what arguments it takes in as input, and the types of those arguments.
  * Specify the output return type.

### 3. Lab

* Practice making a function that will take in a name as an argument and output the 'happy birthday song' to that name.
* Create a function that adds two numbers and returns the sum.

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab. Wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, they could go back and use functions to improve an old project.
