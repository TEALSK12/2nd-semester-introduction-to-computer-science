# Lab 3.01

1) Practice importing random, use `randint` with different arguments. Simulate a dice roll, printing out to the user what number they rolled.

2) Look at the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html) of the random library. Experiment with another function (not `randint`) that returns a value. 

3) Create a program that simulates a [magic 8-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball). Store all of the 8-ball's possible responses (shown below) in a list. Have the program prompt the user to ask the magic 8-ball a question, and then return and print a random response. 

Magic 8-ball response examples: 

* outlook is good
* ask again later
* yes
* no
* most likely no
* most likely yes
* maybe
* outlook is not good

###Bonus!
Research the math library and create a program that finds the length of a triangle given two sides
