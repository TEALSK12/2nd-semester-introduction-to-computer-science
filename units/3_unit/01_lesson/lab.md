Lab 3.01 - Magic 8-Ball
====================================================================================================
**Practice importing random** — Use `randint` with different arguments. Simulate a dice roll,
printing out to the user what number they rolled.

**Look at the [documentation] of the random library** — Experiment with another function (not
`randint`) that returns a value.

**Create a program that simulates a [magic 8-ball]** — Store all of the 8-ball's possible responses
(shown below) in a list. Have the program prompt the user to ask the magic 8-ball a question, and
then return and print a random response.

Magic 8-Ball Response Examples
-------------------------------
  * Outlook is good
  * Ask again later
  * Yes
  * No
  * Most likely no
  * Most likely yes
  * Maybe
  * Outlook is not good

Bonus!
-------
Research the math library and create a program that finds the length of the hypotenuse of a right
triangle given two sides.
