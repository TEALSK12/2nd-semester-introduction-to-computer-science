# Lab 3.01 - Magic 8-Ball

## Practice importing `random`

Use `randint` with different arguments. Simulate a dice roll, printing out to the user what number they rolled.

Look at the [documentation] of the `random` library.
Experiment with another function in the `random` library (not `randint`) that returns a value.

## Create a program that simulates a [Magic 8-Ball]

1. Have the program prompt the user to ask the Magic 8-Ball a question
2. Then return and print a random response.
3. Use `if` and `elif` to statements to decide which response to give the user based on a random number.

### Magic 8-Ball Response Examples

* Outlook is good
* Ask again later
* Yes
* No
* Most likely no
* Most likely yes
* Maybe
* Outlook is not good

## Bonus

Research the `math` library in Python.

Create a program that finds the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given the two perpendicular sides.

Can this program be completed without using `import math`?
