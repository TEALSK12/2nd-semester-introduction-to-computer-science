## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Demo the oregon trail game
  2. Give out instructions and go over game rules
2. Planning
    1. Have students draw out game play. Create functions for each user interaction. Figure out where the repeated code is. Write a function for that. Figure out which variables they will need
    2. Have students plan out their next 7 days. 
    	1. set up user inputs with dummy functions, make sure game loop works
    	2. create variables necessary to run the game, start implementing basic functions
    	3. focus on the random functions
    	4. Figure out how to move the days
    	5. finish day updating 
    	6. connect functions together
    	7. wrap up and game over check is correct
3. Opportunities for more
