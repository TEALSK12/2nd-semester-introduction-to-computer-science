# Sample starter code for Cross Country Canada

# List assumptions of your Cross Country Canada game
# Some examples:
#   Travel is always West. Starts in Vancouver and ends in Halifax.
#   The player eats 5 kg of food every day
#   The player travels between 500km to 1200km each trip, and takes 1-3 days
#   ... etc.

# welcome the user and explain the game rules
welcome_text = """
Welcome to the Cross Country Canada! 

"""

# explain the actions user can take
help_text = """
Each turn you can take one of following actions:

  travel - 
  rest    - 
  buy food  - 
  get commodity - 


When prompted for an action, you can also enter one of these commands without using up your turn:

  status - lists location, health, distance traveled, food available, commodities collected and day of travel.
  help   - lists all the commands.
  quit   - will end the game.
  
You can also use these shortcuts for commands:

  't', 'r', 'b', 'g', 's', '?', 'q'
