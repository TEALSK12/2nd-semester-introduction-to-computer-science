# Simulation game of traveling out west in 1800's

welcome_text = """
Welcome to the Oregon Trail! The year is 1850 and Americans are
headed out West to populate the frontier. Your goal is to travel
by wagon train from Independence, MO to Oregon (2000 miles). You start
on March 1st, and your goal is to reach Oregon by December 31st.
The trail is arduous. Each day costs you food and health. You
can hunt and rest, but you have to get there before winter!
"""

help_text = """
Each turn you can take one of 3 actions:

  travel - moves you randomly between 30-60 miles and takes
           3-7 days (random).
  rest   - increases health 1 level (up to 5 maximum) and takes
           2-5 days (random).
  hunt   - adds 100 lbs of food and takes 2-5 days (random).

When prompted for an action, you can also enter one of these
commands without using up your turn:

  status - lists food, health, distance traveled, and day.
  help   - lists all the commands.
  quit   - will end the game.
  
You can also use these shortcuts for commands:

  't', 'r', 'h', 's', '?', 'q'
