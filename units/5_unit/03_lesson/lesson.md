#Lesson 5.03: Earsketch Control Flow

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **modulo**
* Use looping concepts in music making via EarSketch
* Use control structures to create music
* Review looping and control structures


##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab] - EarSketch Control Flow
* Associated Reading in EarSketch
*  Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Students should be given time to read unit 3 of the EarSketch documentation.
    * Students are expected to write down key terms as they read.
2. **Lesson**
	* Ask the students to highlight what phrases and key terms the students wrote down or remembered from the reading. 
		* Review looping in Python. Look at the examples given in the EarSketch documentation and play them for the class.  
		* Review if statements and control flow. As with looping go over examples (starting at section "Conditional Statements in Loops"). Focus on the **modulo** operator, reminding students that it is an operator that returns the remainder after division.
3. **Lab**
	* Students practice using looping to make a song a single track. Make sure that students use if statements and the modulo operator.
	* Ask the students to practice using looping, effects, and control flow structures while using 2-3 different tracks.
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about any of the common issues that students had with loops and control flow. 

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Students that are moving quickly can read additional documentation on the EarSketch website in order to move ahead and expand their skills and understanding.
