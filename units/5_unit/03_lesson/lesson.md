# Lesson 5.03: Earsketch Control Flow

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **modulo**
* Demonstrate looping and control structures
* Demonstrate the use of looping concepts in music making via EarSketch
* Demostrate using control structures to create music

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now]
* [Lab - EarSketch Control Flow]
* [EarSketch Editor]
* Associated Reading in EarSketch
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students
* Video Explanation of Modulo in Python (Visual Rhythms)

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students should be given time to read unit 3 of the EarSketch documentation.
* Students should answer the questions included in the do now and be prepared to discuss them as a class.

### 2. Lesson

* Call on students to discuss the answers to the questions from the Do Now.
* Review looping in Python. Look at the examples given in the EarSketch documentation and play them for the class.  
* Review if statements and control flow. As with looping go over examples (starting at section "Conditional Statements in Loops"). Focus on the **modulo** operator, reminding students that it is an operator that returns the remainder after division.

### 3. Lab

* Students practice using looping to make a song a single track. Make sure that students use if statements and the modulo operator.
* Ask the students to practice using looping, effects, and control flow structures while using 2-3 different tracks.

### 4. Debrief

* Talk about any of the common issues that students had with loops and control flow.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Students that are moving quickly can read additional documentation on the EarSketch website in order to move ahead and expand their skills and understanding.
