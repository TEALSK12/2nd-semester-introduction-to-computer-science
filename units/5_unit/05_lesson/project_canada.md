# Lesson 5.05: EarSketch Pair Programming Project

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Create a complete song in EarSketch with multiple parts.
* Utilize EarSketch's features and functions.
* Collaborate with a partner to do "pair programming".

### Emphasize with students

#### Curriculum Competencies - Collaborative, Iterative

Creative output like music is best done in collaboration and in the context of community.  Music is meant to be enjoyed and shared.  For this project encourage students to work together in pairs for the whole development process: understanding context, defining, ideating, prototyping, testing, making and sharing.  

Studies have shown that pair programming has many benefits

Typically, one student is the "driver", who types on the keyboard while the other person is the "navigator", who helps directs and watches what the driver is doing.

It breaks the stereotype that programmers work alone in front of the computer all day.  Pair programming makes learning how to code into a more fun and sociable experience.  This model is particularly helpful for students who may feel shy or intimidated in front of peers who have more experience with computers.

As students progress through the song, encourage them to swap roles for each iteration.  This way, both students have a chance to experience being the "driver", and "navigator".

| 15 Minutes  | Debrief / Sharing    |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board.
* For Days 2-5, the Do Now is time for students to write down issues they had with the project from the day before and what they plan on doing to fix those issues.
* Students should take time to create a timeline for when certain tasks will be completed.
* Students should finish the project over a series of "iterations" (or days in our case).
* Each iteration should result in a draft version of the song that can be shared with others in the class for some feedback.

### 2. Project Overview

* Review the terminology, topics, and skills that students have learned from this unit. Talk about any questions or things the students are struggling with.
* Discuss the parts of the song mentioned in the Do Now (chorus, bridge, and verses) and how they fit into building a song.
* Distribute the project spec and talk students through the requirements and scoring rubric.
* A the end of each iteration (or work day), invite a few teams to do a preliminary demo of what they have so far.  
* Feedback from peers can be incorporated into their plans for next day.
* Demo a final song for the students to see a finished product.
* The format for this final demo may be a class party or showcase where others are invited.
* Students can share about their journey and story behind how the song was created.

### 3. Project Planning

* Instruct students to create a project plan for what specifically they will accomplish during each day of the project.
* Take time to check that each student has created a project plan before they begin working on their song.
* Incorporate an iterative approach by aiming to have some intermediate work that can be shared with peers each day.  

#### Emphasize with students again

#### Curriculum Competencies - Collaborative, Iterative, Sharing

In Agile project management, developers stay focused on creating something that works in small cycles, and take time to reflect on client feedback and team experience.  If the project is 5 works days, each day might be an "iteration".

The goal for each iteration should be to have "something working", or "something presentable". In product development, we call it a "minimum viable product", or MVP. Daily sharing of peer progress allows for the cross-pollination of ideas as well.

Finally, when the final project is presented, provide a chance for students to share about their creation journey and project learnings.  This prepares them to be smarter and wiser for their next project.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Certain students that have a limited music background may need additional assistance during the planning phase of the project. Students may need additional examples demonstrating the difference between a verse, chorus, and bridge.
