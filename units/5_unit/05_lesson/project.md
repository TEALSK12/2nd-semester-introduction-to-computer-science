# Project: Song

Using Python and EarSketch you will create a fully fledged song consisting of 2 verses, a chorus, and a bridge. 

## Overview
We have worked in class to practice creating sections of songs. We will use that knowledge to create a song using the samples we are given. 

### Behavior
* The song will have pattern (verse, chorus, verse2, chorus, bridge, chorus)
* Create 4 different variables that will hold your choice of audio constants
* The verses should contain some of the same forms, but be independent. 
* The project should have at least 4 tracks, and each track should use a different/unique sound file (different constant)
* Each verse should consist of at least 8 measures
* The chorus should consist of at least 8 measures
* The bridge should consist of 2-8 measures
* The song should have a flow and underlying themes that recur

### Implementation Details
* Use of for loop for creating tracks
* Use of control flow operators
* Proper use of `fitMedia`, `makeBeat`, `setEffect`
* use of user defined functions for tracking forms and verses and choruses
* use of return statements for tracking the measure

| --------------------------------------------------------------- |-----|
| Song Runs and Plays | 5   |
| Recognizable Chorus vs Verse | 10|
| Correct Length | 5   |
| Contains some reoccurring themes| 5  |
| **Sub total**                                                   | 25  |
| **Technical Correctness   **                                    |     |
| Correct use of loop                                        | 5  |
| Correctly uses control flow         | 5  |
| Correctly use of `fitMedia`, `makeBeat`, `setEffect`                                  | 10  |
