## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board
    * For Days 2-5, the Do Now is time for students to write down issues they had with the project from the day before and what they plan on doing to fix those issues. 
    * Students should take time create a timeline for when certain tasks will be completed.
2. **Project Overview**
	* Review the terminology, topics, and skills that students have learned from this unit. Talk about any questions or things the students are struggling with.
	* Discuss the parts of the song mentioned in the Do Now (chorus, bridge, and verses) and how they fit into building a song.
	* Demo a final song for the students to see a finished product.
3. **Project Planning**	
	* Have students finalize which song they will be creating and write down the parts/structure of that song. 
	* Take time to check that each student has thought through the entirety of their chosen song before moving forward to working on the project. 

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Certain students that have a limited music background may need additional assistance during the planning phase of the project. Students may need additional examples demonstrating the difference between a verse, chorus, and bridge.
