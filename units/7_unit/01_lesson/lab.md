# Lab 7.01: Create a Color Class

In this lab we will create a class that will represent colors and build a function to combine two colors. 

### Background 
RGB is a way of storing color data. R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue. Each color is given a value from 0 to 255. 

You can use this tool to see what different colors are:[http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm](http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm)

## Lab

1. Create a class, `Color`. 
2. Instantiate a few colors.
3. Add attributes of r, g, b to those instances.
4. Create a function, `add_color`, which takes in two colors and returns a color that is the average of the two reds, greens, and blues.
