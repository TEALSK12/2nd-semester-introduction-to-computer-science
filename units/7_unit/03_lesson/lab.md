# Lab 7.03 - Pet Class

In this lab, we will create a Pet class that will keep track of the type of animal, color, food, noise and name of a given animal.

## Create a class called Pet that has the following attributes

* Animal (e.g., dog, cat, fish)
* Color (e.g., spotted, tabby, gold)
* Food (e.g., kibbles, tuna, fish flakes)
* Noise (e.g., meow, woof, splash)
* Name (e.g., Scooby Doo, Fluffy, Bubbles)

## Specifications

1. Make sure to use the `__init__` method to create these attributes.
2. Create a list of pets.
3. Create a function that takes in a list of pets and prints out the name and the food attributes.
4. Test your function with your list of pets.
