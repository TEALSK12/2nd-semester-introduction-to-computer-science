#Lesson 4.04: Nested Lists & Looping

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **nested list**
* Use **nested for loops** to traverse through **nested lists**

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab]
* Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board
2. **Lesson (Part 1)**
	* Go over part 1.1 of the Do Now. Ask students what type my_building is. Discuss **nested lists** as lists that have each element as a list. Ask students to think of some other data that might fit into a **nested list**. What about a game of tic-tac-toe or chess.
		* Go into depth a bit more on nested lists. Ask the students how they would access different parts of the `my_building` example. Call on students. Write down the syntax of `[][]`. The first bracket gets you the floor and the second gets you the room. 
		** Have students practice writing their own nested lists, or work in pairs with one student writing one nested lists and the other student writing another. 
	* Go over part 1.2 of the do now. Asks the students what happened when they iterated over my_building. Have students write their answers up on the board without. Ask other students to explain what was printed out ( should be each floor of the building gets printed out). Ask the students how they would print out each `b` apartment? 
3. **Lab (part 1)**
	* Students will practice accessing items from lists of lists by creating a schedule program and acessing/updating elements
4. ** Debrief(part 1)**
	* Make sure students are able to access elements from the list of lists. 
5. **Lesson (part 2)**
	* Go over part 2.1 of the Do Now
		* This should be a review of looping. If students are having trouble make sure to go over looping.
	* Go over part 2.2 of the Do Now
		* Ask students to write on the board what they did. Discuss how you would write this without the extra function. 
		* Go over how to write this program. How would the alter it to not print out the middle floor. How would they alter to not print out any apartment a's.
6. **Lab (part 2)**
	* Students will create some functions that practice looping through lists of lists
7. **Debrief (part 2)**
	* Ask students if there was any difficulty looping through lists of lists. 
	* Remind students there will be a quiz next class covering everything up till nested lists
