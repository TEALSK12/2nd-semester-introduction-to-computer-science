#Lesson 4.03: Nested For Loop 

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **nested for loops**, **stack trace**
* Use **nested for loops** via a function and a for loop
* Use **nested for loops** via two loops nested
* Use a stack trace to understand flow of **nested for loops**

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab]
* Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board
2. **Lesson**
	* Go over part 1 of the Do Now. 
		* Discuss the output of the program. Were the students able to guess the output without typing it?
			* Go over how to read for loops if students are struggling (drawing the [loop diagram]). Make sure students are understanding loops and string concatenation. If they are not take 5 minutes to go over the loop syntax and practice for a bit longer on this.
	* Go over part 2 of the Do Now. Ask students to write `print_star_squares` function on the board. 
		* **nested for loop**:  a loop within another loop. For each iteration of the outer loop the inner loop is iterated through completely. 
		* Draw a diagram of the for loop (e.g. something like [loop diagram]) ask students to draw the nested part of the state diagram (should be inside the outer loop but look the same as the outer loop)
	* Go over part 3 of the Do Now
		* if students were unable to finish this, give them 5 minutes to practice in groups before calling them back. 
		* Ask students to write on the board how they did this. Ask them how treating the loop as it's own function made it easier or harder. (ideally it should make it easier as a way of abstracting knowledge of looping)
3. **Lab**
	* The lab will ask students to write out different outputs using nested for loops. 
	* If students need extra time for lab there is another day in the schedule for that. This topic can be confusing. 
4. **Debrief**
	* Remind students there will be a quiz in over this after lab is finished. 
	* Go over questions the students had 
	* On the last day go over the bonus and discuss how students thought through which loop needed which conditional
