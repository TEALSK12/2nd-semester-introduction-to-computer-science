# Lesson 4.05: Debugging and Quiz

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Read and understand longer programs involving loops
* Demonstrate their knowledge of looping, lists, and nested loops/lists
* Debug programs involving for loops and lists

## Materials/Preparation

* Quiz (access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard])
* [Lab - Debugging Practice] ([printable lab document]) ([editable lab document])
* [Coding Example]
* Read through the quiz, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students
* Go through the quiz and create an answer key & scoring rubric

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 25 Minutes  | Quiz     |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson     |
| 20 Minutes | Lab         |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Quiz

* Have students start working on the Quiz.

### 2. Lesson

* Talk about how to read code in a loop (you can use something of your choice or the provided [Coding Example])
* Go over debugging practices for loops.
* Use print statements throughout the code to show where error is.
* Alter input to make sure body of loop is working correctly.
* Make sure lists don't go out of bounds/past the end of the list.

### 3. Lab

* This lab will have students start by reading code and looking for errors while **not** at the computer.
* After reading through the code they can practice the debugging practices mentioned on the computer to correct the programs.

### 4. Debrief

* Discuss as a class what was most helpful in debugging, highlight those practices throughout the upcoming project.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Make sure to provide extended time on the quiz for any students that have that requirement in an IEP or 504 plan.
