## Instructor's Notes

1. **Quiz**
    * Have students start working on the Quiz.
2. **Lesson**
	* Talk about how to read code in a loop (you can use something of your choice or the provided [Coding Example])
	* Go over debugging practices for loops. 
		* Use print statements throughout the code to show where error is.
		* Alter input to make sure body of loop is working correctly.
		* Make sure lists don't go out of bounds/past the end of the list.
3. **Lab**
	* This lab will have students start by reading code and looking for errors while **not** at the computer.	
	* After reading through the code they can practice the debugging practices mentioned on the computer to correct the programs.
4. **Debrief**
	* Discuss as a class what was most helpful in debugging, highlight those practices throughout the upcoming project.

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Make sure to provide extended time on the quiz for any students that have that requirement in an IEP or 504 plan.
