# Lesson 4.05: Debugging and Quiz

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Read and understand longer programs involving loops.
* Demonstrate their knowledge of looping, lists, and nested loops/lists.
* Debug programs involving for loops and lists.

## Materials/Preparation

* [4.05 Slide Deck](https://github.com/Areson/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/4_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%204.05%20TEALS.pptx)
* Quiz (access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard][])
* [Lab - Debugging Practice][] ([docx][]) ([pdf][])
* [Coding Example][]
* Read through the quiz, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* Go through the quiz and create an answer key & scoring rubric.

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Quiz

* Have students start working on the quiz.

### 2. Lesson

* Talk about how to read code in a loop (you can use something of your choice or the provided [Coding Example][]).
* Go over debugging practices for loops.
* Use `print` statements throughout the code to show where error is.
* Alter input to make sure body of loop is working correctly.
* Make sure lists don't go out of bounds/past the end of the list.

### 3. Lab

* This lab will have students start by reading code and looking for errors while **not** at the computer.
* After reading through the code they can practice the debugging practices mentioned on the computer to correct the programs.

### 4. Debrief

* Discuss as a class what was most helpful in debugging, highlight those practices throughout the upcoming project.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Make sure to provide extended time on the quiz for any students that have that requirement in an IEP or 504 plan.
Provide an [Additional Coding Example]) for students that finish the lab exercises early.
