# Lesson 8.3 - Building a Plan

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Identify the main components of a functional project specification and explain the purpose of each section.
* Develop a project idea into a full, detailed specification.

## Materials/Preparation

* Students should each have their [final project plan organizer][] and [final project development plan][]
* Review [4 steps to solve any CS problem][]
* [Scoring rubric](../rubric.md) ([docx](../rubric.docx))([pdf](../rubric.pdf))

## Pacing Guide

| Duration  | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 5 minutes | Do Now |
| 10 minutes | Review feature lists and flow chart |
| 20 minutes | Spec writing |
| 15 minutes | Building implementation plan|
| 5 minutes | Debrief and wrap-up|

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Project the Do Now on the board, circulate around the class to check that students are working and understand the instructions.

### 2. Review feature lists and flow chart

* If time allows, ask one or two students to share their feature list and/or flow chart and discuss with the class.
* Ensure that students have an understanding of the proper level of detail at this point.

#### Spec writing

* Using the details from their pitch, their feature lists, their flow charts, and the feedback they've received, students should fill out the rest of the [Final Project Plan Organizer].

##### Vital

* At this stage students be as detailed and thorough as they can.  
* Any missing information will complicate the process later when they realize what was left out.  
* Encourage students to take their time and make sure they hit everything.
* While this process is happening, instructors should circulate through the class and check-in with student.  
* Verify that they have a complete, well-thought out idea that is feasible to complete in the available time.  
* If you have concerns about a student's ability to complete the proposed project, help them scope down by removing or simplifying features.

### 3. Implementation plan

* Students should use the details built in their plan organizer to list the tasks necessary on their [Final Project Development Plan][].
* Emphasize to students that tasks should be at a very low level of granularity (hence the time requirement being specified in minutes).
* If a single task has a time estimate of more than a few hours, the student should try to break the task into smaller pieces.
* Ensure that students do not skip "trivial" or "simple" tasks (such as building a script they have written before) or non-coding tasks (such as developing graphics) in their plan.

### 4. Debrief

* As class ends, remind students that their spec and implementation plan will be their guides throughout the process.  
* They should update them each day and keep them with them at all times.
* Ideally, anytime there is a question about the requirements or scope of the project, the spec should have the answer.  
* If not, it's a new idea and the spec needs to be updated accordingly.
