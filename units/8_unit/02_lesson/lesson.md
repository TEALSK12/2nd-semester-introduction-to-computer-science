# Lesson 8.2 - Defining Requirements

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define key scenarios for a project and the features required to implement each scenario.
* Explain the importance of flow charting when designing an application.

## Materials/Preparation

* Students should each have their [final project plan organizer][] and [final project development plan][]
* Review [4 steps to solve any CS problem][]
* [Scoring rubric](../rubric.md) ([docx](../rubric.docx))([pdf](../rubric.pdf))

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Project the Do Now on the board, circulate around the class to check that students are working and understand the instructions.

### 2. Review Pitches

* If desired, give students a few minutes to rework their pitches or get more feedback from a classmate or instructor.
* Ask students to choose which idea they want to pursue, and write it down on the top of their [Final Project Plan Organizer][].

### 3. Scenarios

* A description of a set of interactions and/or tasks that describe a start-to-finish example of how a user might want to use the application.
* Explain that defining scenarios helps a programmer focus on what features are actually necessary to enable the key user interactions for their application.
* Instruct students to write down at least **3** scenarios for their project describing, from start to finish, interactions a user might have with their program to accomplish a specific goal.
* The scenarios should have a moderate level of detail in the description of the user interaction (e.g. "print a board," "input their name," etc.) but should not include any design or implementation details.
* Since this semester is text based a scenario would more likely be: text-based user flows (interactions with the console).
* Once students have written their scenarios, they should review them and develop a list of the necessary features to enable each scenario.
* there should be minimal technical detail in these descriptions, instead focusing on details of the user experience.  The feature lists should should be more about _requirements_ than implementation.

### 3. Flow Chart

* The different paths a user can take through a program.
* At each step write down what options the user has and what scenarios that can lead to.
* Similar to the wire frame of last semester (wire-frames typically deal with screens, so a flow chart is a good alternative).
* Flow Charts do not include any details (such as specific text), but instead provide a broad impression of what an application will be like to aid in design and planning.
* Students will complete page 1 of the organizer by writing out the important interactions of their program.
* Encourage students to reference their feature lists to ensure they include _all_ necessary interactions for their project, including simple things like a intro interaction, help interaction, or exit ("game over").

### 4. Debrief

* As class ends, ensure students retain their work as they will use it to construct a detailed specification and implementation plan tomorrow.
