#Lesson 1.02: Interactive Mode

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: interpreter, prompt, string, integer, value, errors, console
* Use the Python interpreter to do simple math
* Given a value, be able to distinguish between number and string 

## Deliverables
* written worksheet with predictions and results

##Materials/Preparation
* [Lab]
* Ensure all students are able to log into the system
* Read through the handout, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note
1. Do Now
	1. Display photo of the IDE and asks students to label the IDE
	2. After labeling the IDE have students make sure they can log into their IDE account
2. Lesson 
	1. Say the part on bottom half of the screen is called a console:
		1. Define: Console is a place where you can interact with a program. Sometimes called a shell or a terminal
		2. Define: Interpreter runs Python code
	2. To run Python interpreter type `Python3` into the terminal. 
		1. Make sure all the students are able to do this and then give out worksheet
3. Lab part 1 
	1. Go over lab part 1, before assigning lab part 2. 
	2. What did you notice about part 1? 
		1.	What does the // do. How is that different from %
		2.	What’s the difference between 3.0 and 3?
		3.	Floats: a data type, number with a decimal point
		4.  Integers: a data type, number without a decimal point
	3.	What did you notice about part 2?
		1.	What happened when you typed in a?
		2.	What do you think that error message mean? 
		3.	String: a data type, characters surrounded in single or double quotes.
	4.	What did you notice about part 3?
		1.	What was the difference between the two inputs?
		2.	Strings can be combined using plus sign
		3.	What do you think the error message means?		
		4.  Can’t combine different types
	5.	What did you notice about part 4?
		1.	What error did you get? What do you think that means 
		2.  What happens when you multiply strings?
4. Lab part 2
    1. Define Expressions: a combination of values and operators [and variables]
    2. Ask students to give an example of expressions 
    3. Make sure students do the first part at their desk before going to the computer 
5. Debrief
	1. Discuss any surprising results. 
		1. Adding strings together using plus. 
		2. Single vs double quotes
		3. Multiplying strings
		4. Order of Operations is the same
	2. Discuss why it might be helpful to have an interactive console? How is it different than snap? 
6. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, have students practice higher order-of-operations problems. Or practice having them save variables.
