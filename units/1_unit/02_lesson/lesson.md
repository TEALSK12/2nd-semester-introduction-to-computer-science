#Lesson 1.02: Interactive Mode

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **interpreter, prompt, string, integer, float, value, errors, console**
* Use the Python interpreter to evaluate simple math expressions
* Distinguish between an integer, float, and string

##Assessment
* Lab worksheet with predictions and results

##Materials/Preparation
* [Lab] worksheet
* Ensure all students are able to log into the system
* Go through the lab so that you are familiar with the requirements/results and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
	* Display a photo of the Cloud9 IDE and asks students to identify the three key parts (file tree, terminal, editor) of the IDE.
	* After going over the three parts of the IDE have students check that they can still log into their IDE account.
2. **Lesson** 
	* The part on bottom half of the screen is called a *console*:
		* The *console* is a place where you can interact with a program. It can also be called a shell or a terminal.
		* The *interpreter* runs Python code.
	* To run the Python interpreter, type `python3` into the terminal. 
		* Make sure all the students are able to do this and then give out the lab worksheet.
3. **Lab part 1** 
	* Give students time to work on section 1, then pause to ask questions. 	
	    *	What does the // do? How is that different from %?
		*	What’s the difference between 3.0 and 3?
		*	*Floats*: a data type, number with a decimal point.
		*  *Integers*: a data type, number without a decimal point.
	3.	Pause to ask questions about section 2.
		*	What happened when you typed in a?
		*	What do you think that error message mean? 
		*	String: a data type, characters surrounded in single or double quotes.
	4.	Pause to ask qeustions about section 3.
		*	What was the difference between the two inputs?
		*	Strings can be combined using plus sign.
		*	What do you think the error message means?		
	    	*   You can’t combine different types!
	5.	Pause to ask questions about section 4.
		*	What error did you get? What do you think that means?
		*  What happens when you multiply strings?
4. **Lab part 2**
    1. Define Expressions: a combination of values and operators [and variables]
    2. Ask students to give an example of expressions 
    3. Make sure students do the first part at their desk before going to the computer 
5. **Debrief**
	1. Discuss any surprising results. 
		1. Adding strings together using plus. 
		2. Single vs double quotes
		3. Multiplying strings
		4. Order of Operations is the same
	2. Discuss why it might be helpful to have an interactive console? How is it different than snap? 
6. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, have students practice higher order-of-operations problems. Or practice having them save variables.
