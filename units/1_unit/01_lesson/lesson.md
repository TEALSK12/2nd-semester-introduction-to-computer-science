#Lesson 1.01: Set Up

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **IDE**, **Python**
* Identify the key concepts that will be covered in the course
* Set up and log into an account for the course's online IDE
* Save and turn in a file via the online IDE

##Materials/Preparation
* Update the collaboration policy, IDE information, grading percentages, and general syllabus based on your preferences and your school's requirements
* Create an account on online IDE and update the student Sign Up Guide with your username
* Update the student Sign Up Guide with file naming and turn-in conventions for your course
* [Sign Up Guide], [Sign Up Guide pdf]: the IDE guide for students 
* [Sign Up Guide Teachers]: the IDE guide for teachers
* [Python Code]: code to display and have students submit online

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Hand out syllabus for students to begin reading [Sign Up Guide pdf].
2. **Syllabus**
	* Guide students through the syllabus, pausing for questions as needed.
    * Make sure to note the overarching goals for the course: create functioning Python programs, learn to use basic data types, and learn to use a text-based language.
	* Present demo of a program written in Python to hook students and to give them an idea of what they will be working with.
3. **Python/IDE Intro**
	* Python
		* **Python** is a text-based programming language, uses tabbing/indentation to control execution, and is known for its readability. 
		* Show [Python Code].  Ask students to write down at least 3 specific things they observe about the program/code.
	        * Possible responses might include: indentation, different colors of text, using "print" instead of "say" (Snap).
	        * Discuss what students observed.
	* IDE
		* **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment 
		* An **IDE** is an application that allows you to create, edit, save, and run programs.
		    * Point out that for this course we will be using an online IDE.
		* Note that with Python, we can't use drag and drop blocks anymore - it is a language that must be typed into an IDE. 
		* Talk to students about the different areas and parts of the IDE, use the [Python Code] to demo once more how it looks/works.
4. **Students Create Accounts & Submit Work**
	* Hand out the IDE [Sign Up Guide]. This explains to students how to sign up for the IDE, step-by-step. Make sure to update this with your account information so that the students share their accounts/work with the correct names.
	* Have students write their username and password on the paper and/or take a photo on their phones so that they remember for future classes.
	* Hello World exercise
		* Display [Python Code].  
		* Have students create a a new Python file
		* Save file as "hello_world.py"
		* Have students type in the displayed code into the blank `hello_world.py` file
		* Have students 'turn in' their work by submitting online to Learning Management System(LMS). If you would like to have a class-wide convention for file name saving make sure to update it in the [Sign Up Guide]. 
	* If students finish early, encourage them to explore the interface and to try creating a program that prints their name.
