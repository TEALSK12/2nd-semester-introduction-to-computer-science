3. Verify your email address
4. Click the link to go to your dashboard. 

## Turn in procedure
There are two different ways to turn in: 
1. Have students share their workspace with the teachers/TAs. Only needs to happen one time and gives teachers read/write access to the students files. 
    ## Sharing Workspace
    Once students have shared their workspaces, their work can be found in the "Shared With Me" section

2. Have students download their file and upload it to the school's file system (or however students normally hand in electronic files at the particular school)
