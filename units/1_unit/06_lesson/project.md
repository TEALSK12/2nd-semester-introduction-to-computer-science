# Project 1: Mad Libs

Using Python, students will use variables, input, and printing to create a Mad Lib. You will also practice *designing* a project by planning out your Mad Lib before implementing it.

## Overview
Mad Libs are a fun way to tell a story. The story is pre-written except for a few words. The user fills in the words before seeing the story. Then the story is read off with the user's words mixed in! 

## Details
### Behavior
* The program will print out the title of the Mad Libs story, as well as a short explanation of game play    
    ```
    A Day in NYC: a Mad Lib.
    Welcome! You are about to play a fantastic word game. 
    I will ask you for nouns, verbs, adjectives, proper nouns and adverbs. 
    Using those words I will create an unexpected story for you!
    ```
* The program should then prompt the user to enter in nouns, verbs, adjectives, proper nouns, and adverbs
!(Example running)[mad_libs_screen_shot.png]
* After all the words have been entered. The program will print out the story.
```
A Day in NYC: 
It was a beautiful day in New York City. Our hero Ariana Grande was on a walk from the Standard to Duane Reade.Ariana Grande was walking rather quickly because he/she had lived in New York for a few months.All of a suden a slimey donut appeared out of nowhere!!!Ariana Grande decided to prance foolishly instead of dealing with the situation.Thrown off from Duane Reade Ariana Grande decides to go to Times Squareinstead.What a beautiful day in New York.
```

### Implementation Details
As mentioned above the program must request words from the user. The following must be included in the program: 
* 10 different words inputted
* variable names should correspond to the part of speech requested and part of the story they belong to
* only use 3 print statements
