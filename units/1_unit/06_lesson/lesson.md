## Instructors Notes

### 1. 4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem

* Introduce students to the [4 Steps to Solve Any CS Problem]

### 2.  Project Overview

* Introduce students to the Mad Lib concept by using a short, written out Mad Lib on the whiteboard, poster paper, or projector.
* Pass out and the project specification and walk students through all the requirements and potential challenges.
* Emphasize that prompts must ask for the correct noun-verb combinations.
* Encourage students to look at the grading rubric on page two repeatedly throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements.
* Demo a sample project solution (access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard](https://www.tealsk12.org/dashboard/)) for students to see how a completed program should function.
* Identify the sub problems of Mad Libs
* Have students list what variables, inputs, and print statements they will need  

### 3.  Project Work

* This project is a summative assessment for the unit. Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.
* Most students will require roughly 1 hour of total work time to complete the project
* Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstrate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.
* Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students
* It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on
* If most students have the ability to work on assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.
* If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who not able to work at home, such as after school lab hours
* Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project

### 4. Wrap Up - Student Demos

* Celebrate and showcase student work once projects are completed.
* Have students demonstrate their Mad Libs for the class, with the class choosing what nouns/verbs/etc to use for the story.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Ask students to research casting. Have them add, subtract, or multiply values as part of the story.
