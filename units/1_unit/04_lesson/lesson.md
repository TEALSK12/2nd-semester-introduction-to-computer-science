# Lesson Plan 1.04: Variables and User Input

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **comments**, **storing**, **mutable**, **variable assignment**,** input**
* Assign and swap variables
* Store user input into a variable

##Materials/Preparation
* Do Now
* [Worksheet]
* Read through the Do Now, Worksheet, and lesson so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Pacing Guide
| **Duration**   |     **Description**    |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now             |
| 25 Minutes  | Continue Do Now & Discussion |
| 20 Minutes | Magic Genie Lab|
| 5 Minutes | Debrief         |

## Instructor's Note
1. **Do Now**
    * Make sure that students are working as soon as they get to class. 
2. **Do Now Work & Discussion**
	* Input Discussion
		*	Discuss answers to the questions written in the Do Now. 
		*	Explain that *comments* are not executed by the interpreter
		*	Discussion Questions: 
		    *	What did `input` do? 
		    *	What did the string between the parentheses do? 
		    *	What would changing that string do? (it changes the prompt given to the user) 
		* Define *input*: user data given to the app. 
		* Explain that in Python `input` lets a program take input from the terminal and use it in the code. Recall using input from snap.
		* Display on the screen: ![Snap Input](snap_input.png)
			* Ask students what things from Python they will need to create this program. 
			* Ask students to take 3 minutes to convert this to Python.
			* Call some students up to write their answers on the board.
			* Practice changing the argument to input function in class. (ex. How would you have the computer ask what month the students were born in?)
	*	Swapping Variables Discussion
		*	Provide students with additional time to work on this portion of the Do Now worksheet. 
		*	Discuss student results.
			*	Have students write answers on the board, or call on students to give you answers line by line and you write the code on board or type out. 
		*	Discuss the idea of setting variables to be other values. 
			*	What would happen if you don’t store a into c in this program? 
			*	*Mutability*: you can change an existing value
3.  **Magic Genie Lab**
	*	Make sure students feel comfortable saving things as variables and can print multiple things.
	*	Troubleshoot with students and try to recognize early which students are struggling.
4.	**Debrief**
	*	Discuss any issues that came up in the magic genie program.
		*	Were there any error messages? What do they mean?
	    *	Did anyone use more than one variable? 
		*	Review concepts so far: **variables, interpreter, terminal, string, integer, run, output, swapping**
