# Lesson Plan 1.05: Quiz & Debugging

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Demonstrate their understanding of key concepts covered up to this point
* Define and identify: **debugging, syntax errors**
* Analyze and respond to error messages

## Materials/Preparation

* Download quiz and Answer key(access protected resources by clicking on "Additional Curriculum Materials" on the [TEALS Dashboard])
* [Associated Readings 1.3](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/readings#1-3)
* Take the quiz
* After taking the quiz yourself, take a look at the answer key provided in the additional curriculum materials.
* Create a scoring rubric
* Look through [http://tinyurl.com/TEALS-Python-Errors] web tutorial to dig deeper yourself into analyzing and responding to errors

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration** | **Description**    |
|-------------:|:-------------------|
|    5 Minutes | Welcome and Review |
|   25 Minutes | Quiz               |
|   25 Minutes | Debugging Activity |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Welcome and Review

* Ask students for any final questions before passing out the quiz.

### 2. Quiz

### 3. Debugging Activity

* Explain to students that you will now be exploring how to read analyze and respond to errors in code.

* Ask students to read through it and predict what will be printed out.

  ```Python
  favorite_number_str = input("What is your favorite number: ")
  birth_month_str = input("What month where you born in: ")
  lucky_number = int(favorite_number_str) + int(birth_month_str)
  print("Your lucky number is " + lucky_number)
  ```

* Remind students that when reading through code we go line by line, as if we are the interpreter.

#### Demonstration

* Run the code, display the stack trace, and have students analyze the error message reported.
* Explain that, much like in Snap, **debugging** is the process of tracking and fixing errors in your code.
* Indentation Errors: Errors the students are most likely to have seen
* "IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level"
* Ask student why these errors are caused and how they find/fix this type of error? Suggest using the tab key to indent and the shift-tab to remove an indent as ways to avoid the error.
* Direct students to work through and complete this web tutorial on [debugging]

### Accommodation/Differentiation

Make sure to provide extended time on the quiz for any students who need extra time
