# Lesson Plan 1.05: Quiz & Debugging

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...
* Demonstrate their understanding of key concepts covered up to this point
* Define and identify: **debugging, syntax errors**
* Analyze and respond to error messages

##Materials/Preparation
* [Quiz]
* Take the quiz and create a scoring rubric
* Look through [debugging] web tutorial and example [code] to prepare students for analyzing and responding to errors

## Pacing Guide
| **Duration**   |     **Description**    |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 5 Minutes  | Welcome and Review      |
| 25 Minutes | Quiz               |
| 25 Minutes | Debugging Activity |

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Welcome and Review**
    * Ask students for any final questions before passing out the quiz.
2. **Quiz**
3. **Debugging Activity**
	* Explain to students that you will now be exploring how to read analyze and respond to errors in code. 
		* Present students with a longer piece of code that will produce an error (e.g. [code]). Ask them to read through it and predict what will be printed out.
		* Remind students that when reading through code we go line by line, as if we are the interpreter. 
		* Run the code, display the stack trace, and have students analyze the error message reported.
		* Explain that, much like in Snap, *debugging* is the process of tracking and fixing errors in your code.
	* Direct students to work through and complete this web tutorial on [debugging]

###Accomodation/Differentiation
Make sure to provide extended time on the quiz for any students that have that requirement in an IEP or 504 plan.
