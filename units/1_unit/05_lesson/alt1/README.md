Alternate Lesson 1.05: Debugging in Python
====================================================================================================

Summary
--------
I didn’t love the materials for Unit 1, Day 5. I found the quiz not that valuable, and the
interactive debugging activity had a ton of reading that made it hard for students to distill the
main points.

So I wrote my own alternative debugging activity using [Google Colab]. There’s still a lot of
reading, but it’s more focused and not quite so philosophical. I’ve retained the interactive nature
of the activity, but using Google Colab instead of CodeLens.

- [Colab notebook](./TEALS2018_Lab_1_05.ipynb)
- [Activity PDF](./TEALS2018-Lab105.pdf)
- [Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZhOxu5ZBcffOhHZ-9pJMLeByjjLF4Av6OQPpZ8jt-2k/edit#slide=id.p)

Our overall class website is http://www.mskostant.org/python6.

We ran the lesson twice yesterday (2 different classes at our school) and it went extremely well
each time.

The main downside of Colab is that it requires students have a Google account to use the notebook.
Not a problem for us, as the school uses Google Docs etc. throughout. But if you don’t have that
situation, you could still use the lesson by asking the students to read the PDF, and copy-paste the
code examples into Trinket or whatever Python IDE you are using.
