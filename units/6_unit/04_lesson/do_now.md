# Do Now 6.04 

1. Type and run the following code in the interpreter

    ```python
my_dictionary = {
	'a': 1,
	'b': 2,
	'c': 3, 
	'd': 4, 
	'e': 5 
}
print(my_dictionary.keys())
    ```
Write down what `keys()` does. What type does `keys()` return? 

2. Write down how you might use a for loop to go through the values of my_dictionary. Try your solution using the interpreter.
