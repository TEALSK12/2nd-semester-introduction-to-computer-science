# Lab 6.01 - Dictionaries & Memes

Write a dictionary that gives context to 'internet memes'.  Write a program, `dictionary_lab.py`, that prompts a user for what meme or abbreviation they want to look up. If the word is in the dictionary (use the `in` keyword to test), then you will print out the definition. If the word is not in the dictionary, the program will print out that the word is not defined. 

### Example Output

```
>>> python3 dictionary_lab.py
What word would you like to look up? nbd
nbd: a phrase meaning no big deal
What word would you like to look up? kittens
Sorry, kittens is not defined
What would would you like to look up? 
```

## Bonus
Create a way to update values and add key/value pairs to the dictionary. Search for dictionaries in the Python documentation.
