## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board.
* Students type code that edits dictionaries by modifying, adding, or removing key:value pairs.

### 2. Lesson

#### Part 1 of the Do Now

* Discuss what the students learned from Part 1, and go over what the code is doing.
* Describe that you can update a value in a dictionary in a similar way to how you would update a value in a list.

#### Part 2 of the Do Now

* Discuss what the students learned from Part 2, and go over what the code is doing.
* Note that you can add values to a dictionary by using the same syntax.
* Review: How might you check if a value was in a dictionary before adding it?

#### Part 3 of the Do Now

* Discuss what the students learned from Part 3, and go over what the code is doing.
* Review what **pop** does, as well as what the second argument does.
* This is the value that will be returned if the first argument is not in the dictionary.

### 3. Lab

* Students will create a word count algorithm that will count the number of words in a list of words.

### 4. Debrief

* Talk about any confusion the students had. Discuss additional ideas of how dictionaries might be useful.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Some students may need to be explicitly reminded of the `in` keyword to check if a certain key is in their dictionary.
