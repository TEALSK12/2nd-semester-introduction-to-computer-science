    * Students type code that edits dictionaries by either adding or removing key:value pairs.
2. **Lesson**
	* Ask the students about part 1 of Do Now
		* Describe that you can update a value in a dictionary by setting it like how you would set a list. 
	* Ask students about part 2 of Do Now
		* Can add values to the dictionary by using the same syntax.
		* How would you check if a value was in a dictionary before adding it? 
	* Ask students about part 3 of the Do Now?

			* Second argument is the default value. This is the value that will be returned if the first argument is not in the dictionary. 
3. **Lab**
