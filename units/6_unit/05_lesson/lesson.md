## Instructor's Notes - Day 1

### 1. Do Now

* Display the Do Now on the board.
* Students should take a few moments to rank which topics they found most difficult during this unit.

### 2. Review

* Take time to review the concepts students found most challenging during this unit.

### 3. Project Overview

* Go over the project spec details with the students.
* Demo a completed project.

### 4. Planning

* Have the students design the variables, functions, dictionaries, lists, and structure they need, using pseudo code to help them visualize.
* Have the students write out a plan /outline for how they will spend time over next few days.
* Any students that finish their plan and have it checked should begin project work.

## Instructor Notes - Days 2-7

### 1. Planning/Questions

* Have the students write down what they want to accomplish that day and any questions they have from the previous class.

### 2. Review (if necessary)

* Go over any concepts or challenges that students are having.

### 3. Project Work

* Students work independently to complete their projects and meet their daily goals

### 4. **Wrap Up**

* Discuss common issues that students were having each day, provide suggestions for how to overcome those challenges.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* Some students may need a refresher on using a `while` loop to control whether the game is over or not.
* Some students may also need additional assistance or scaffolding for how to randomly choose a character from the dictionary.
* For students who are looking for more of a challenge, we have added a second project called [Project Spec - Buy an Umbrella]
